Who am I, what am I, and where am I are questions you are forced to consider as you read and reread this book.

The story is told through the eyes of a young girl growing up in a very poor family. It tells of her life from grade school to adulthood. The family experiences  many tragedies along the way to eventual happiness. I got this book because  it was the most read book by GI's during WWII. I did not know what it was  about. It has great characters, stories and a upbeat ending. I would  recommend it to teenagers who want I look at life from a different  perspective.	1999-10-12

Some of my favorite tracks are #1,3,7, and the last one Underground.  We have all seen the movie and heard the music.  If not then I highly suggest watching it.  The music in my opinion takes me to  another world of joy and excitement.  Listen to some of the examples and  try to imagine being somewhere else.  That should help you decide that it  is a great cd and a must for every music collection.  David Bowie and  Trevor Jones did a wonderful job with it.  Two thumbs up or 5 Stars and a  half.	1999-11-21

I have never seen Dangerous Liasions, but I really can't imagine as it was made a long time ago, that it is like THIS!. So why are you guys comparing these two movies  and just don't see them on their own? What I mean is that in the original  there are surely NO lesbians, NO homosexuals and certainly NO one saying :  That's an orgasm! You should see them on their own. Anyway, I don't know  much movies that make leave you sad, thinking and at the same time you are  laughing your a.. off!  The Plot itself is absolutely great and Sebastian's  change to a good guy is absolutely beliveable. The Actors absolutely  superb, just take Sarah Michelle Geller as the hot evil girl and Ryan  Phillipe as the most arrogant and ignorant person I have seen in a movie  for a long time. And if you compare his skills to Di Caprio: FORGET IT, HE  IS A REAL ACTOR THAT DOESN'T NEED A BUNCH OF TEEN GIRLS SCREAMING AFTER  HIM. I highly recommend this movie!	2000-06-20

I didn't get to see X-men while it was in the theaters, so when my husband and I bought the DVD, I was worried about a little something I like to call &quot;Overhype Syndrome&quot;: you know, when everybody you know sees a movie before you do, and they all tell you how great it is, and by the time you see it, you're expecting great things, and when you don't get them, you're all let down and ready to hurt someone. Well, I've read every review, and visited the website, and all my friends have seen it, and I was definately expecting great things. And I got them. I got them all. Every expectation was met. Not too much bad dialog to clog up the flow of the story, no drawn out mush scenes dragging down the pace. It was great. Cyclops was the perfect uptight geek, Jean Grey was appropriately Goody-Goody, and the best part, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos didn't mess up her part by trying to act. Sure, there were things that didn't follow the comic book (Wolverine was a little tall, and Rogue had a real name, and Storm wasn't claustrophobic), but none of it really mattered. The only really major change was Magneto's origin, but that was to make his reasoning look like more than just pure evil. Anyway, the movie was AWESOME! If you haven't seen it yet, see it. If you don't own it, buy it!	2000-11-22

Before I start describing how good the movie was, I want to stop at both actors Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. If they are put in a silent movie, of no words and not even subtitles, they can make the film emotionally rich just by their facial expressions! I mean, you easily fall in love with those two actors because of their emotional faces and eyes.<br />The is a light movie, that all family can enjoy watching together. It's based on emotional conflict between a family with two kids and a stepmom (Julia Roberts). In this movie you'll enjoy the emotional driven laughs and tears all the way until the end.<br />One of the things that you'll enjoy most in this film is that you'll enjoy your life better and appreciate more many things in your life that you have taken for granted.<br />THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.

US	45083948	R1GKPXLOW4MRQI	B000002LRX	143353260	Angel Dust	Music	5	1	2	N	N	Legendary album from a legendary band	I have read many a review on this site but have never really got around to writing one for myself as it is difficult to put this album into words. However, after reading so many other reviews by fans who worship this album, I realised that I just had to put in my two cents.<BR>Firstly, I had no idea that so many people love this album. In a world where unoriginal tripe is lapped up by the masses, its refreshing to know that there are still people who know a quality album when they hear it. Aah.<br />'Angel Dust' is a great eclectic mix of everything, with that great Faith No More twist. The three singles, 'Midlife Crisis', 'Everything's Ruined' and 'A Small Victory' are three undescribable, uncatergorizable songs. They are well worth the money alone. There are some harder songs, like 'Jizzlobber', 'Caffeine' and 'Malpractice', the latter being very reminiscent of Mr.Bungle (loaded with samples and tempo changes). 'Land of Sunshine' is a great track to sing along to and contains the most sarcastic lyrics in the history of mankind. 'Crack Hitler' is a totally funky tune with a twist in the middle (those who own the album will know what I mean). 'RV' is a good take on music, but sadly Mike's monologue ruins the subtlety of the joke. Excellent chorus and bridge though. <BR>As a bassist, I find this album is very impressive, especially in 'Land of Sunshine' (bass plays the main riff) and 'Kindergarten' (bass solo!). It also uses things that you would not normally hear in 'alternative rock' songs, like african chanting ('Smaller and Smaller'), cheerleading chants ('Be Aggressive') and horror violins ('Jizzlobber' - you'll know what I mean when you hear it). And, unlike other bands who try and do that sort of thing and fail miserably, these work really well.<BR>The final thing I have to say is that I usually hate it when bands put covers on albums. However, it is again different on 'Angel Dust'. 'Midnight Cowboy' offers a nice antidote after the frenetic 'Jizzlobber', andtheir version of 'Easy' (if you own the version tha has it) has become so well known that it is almost their own. Sorry to ramble, but this album is so good... It may take afew listenings to get used to, but it is worth it.	2001-10-25

The songs have a distinct sixties sound and are fantastic. What impresses me most with the Doors is their astonishing array of tunes. As a singer, I always thought Jim was great, mostly due to his tremendous range and emotional flexibility. On the title track, \\\\\"Strange Days,\\\\\" Jim conjures that haunting Goth sound that I love. Then comes \\\\\"You're Lost Little Girl,\\\\\" which is an evocative ballad that offers no resolution except the refrain \\\\\"I think that you know what to do...\\\\\" Next comes \\\\\"Love Me Two Times;\\\\\" one of my favorite blues songs by the band. Horse Latitudes is a great experimental piece that is a protracted and passionate poetry reading set to loud and stormy impressionistic sounds. The lines \\\\\"Poise, Delicate, Pause, Consent, In mute nostril agony\\\\\" to describe the horses laboriously making their way through the water is typical Jim in his creative glory. Then comes \\\\\"Moonlight Drive\\\\\" a great youthful and exploratory piece that shows Jim's dreamy and romantic side. But as is typical of Jim, there is always an edge in his brand of romantic crooning (if we can even call it that!). He sings, \\\\\"You reach your hand to hold me, but I can't be your guide.\\\\\" I love the way he always inserts that twist to whatever he's contemplating. \\\\\"People Are Strange\\\\\" is Jim's great exploration of alienation. \\\\\"My Eyes have See You\\\\\" has a great sixties rocking sound to it. \\\\\"I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\\\\\" is a real mysterious and sensual ballad. \\\\\"When the Music Is Over\\\\\" is another great protracted tune that has a hard and sensual beat. Wow! What an album! The music is classic, and John, Robbie and Ray are brilliant musicians who always play at their best. All music reviews are subjective, and I'm sure there are those who may not share my tastes. But all in all, this is an album with range and emotional flexibility on which I'm sure any Doors fan can find a song that they like. This is definitely one of my favorite Doors albums."	2002-09-26

"Those are just a few words that describe 2Pac's 6th and final album he had hands on. This album became the subject of controversy not only for its content, but for the time it came out: for it was released just 2 months after Pac's death. All of Pac's first 6 albums are brilliant in their own way, but this final album was phrophetic and haunting, and culminating in what many consider to be his best work ever. Lyrically, this is his most advanced album. His wordplay was getting stronger, and he was developing into a true MC. His subject matter was increasing, and the intensity and passion in his voice was louder than ever. In some songs, he is almost screaming, making you feel his pain [see his second verse in Hold Ya Head for a good example]. It has the uplifting spirit of his other classic album, Me Against The World, and the intensity of All Eyez On Me [but to an even greater degree].<br />However, it wasnt just the fact he was improving so rapidly from album to album. It was the evolution from his debut album to this one. When 2Pacalypse Now came out, his charisma and power was already in place, but he was a mere political rapper....5 albums later, he was a PHROPHET. The album starts off with the intro of a news reporter talking about the east/west coast war, which was at the boiling point during this albums making. It goes right into Bomb First, one of his most angry and energetic tracks ever. He calls out various east coast artists here, and it is apparant things were getting out of hand. Pac kept it diverse though, not letting his beef with Biggie and the east coast consume him.  Alot of people call this a \\\\\"war\\\\\" album, but there are is in fact only one true diss song on the entire album [Against All Odds], though he does make some minor disses in Toss It Up and at the end of To Live And Die In LA. Hail Mary is one of his deepest songs ever, and is one of the many mysterious songs on this album. Many of the lyrics have double meanings, and there are several clues which have made people think he was still alive [Im pretty sure he is dead, but that is another topic I wont get into right now]. Blasphemy, one of his best songs ever, is one of these. In this track, Pac gets deep, REAL deep. He speaks on religion, thug life, and God himself in this song. Just Like Daddy is his usual song for the ladies....White Manz World is probably his most political track since anything he did on Strictly 4 My Niggaz, a powerful composition of racism and oppression. Hold Ya Head is a similiar song, but made for important political figures he feels should be free. The most personal song on the album is Krazy. This has almost a Dear Mama type feel to it, but with a twist. Toss It Up and To Live In Die In LA are more commercial, but are great songs nevertheless, and round out the album well. Less noticable is Life Of An Outlaw, which is a good song, but probably belongs on the All Eyez On Me cd. Pac was getting more advanced conceptually as well. Me And My Girlfriend is the rawest song on the album, a tale about a man and his relationship with a gun, described as a woman in metaphoric form. The dialouge with the lady shouting and the dark beat add to the effect of the song. The album is ended with what is probably his greatest diss song ever, Against All Odds, where he pulls almost everyone's card, from Puffy to the agent who set him up, to Nas. Its hard to choose a fav song on this record, because all of them are pure genius, but Hail Mary, Blasphemy, Me And My Girlfriend, and Krazy stand as four of his best penned songs ever.<br />This is not only an essential 2Pac album, but an essential hip hop album. Though All Eyez On Me is probably his most popular album, and a classic in its own right, this cd stands as his true gem. The way the album is structured, the amazing production WITHOUT any big name producers, and his elevated lyricism and song writing certified him as a hip hop phrophet, and one of the greatest artists of our time. This cd displays every side of Pac imaginable, and is his most thought provoking and intense album to date. If you dont have this album, what are you waiting for?? Stop reading this review and go and buy the damn thing.....we will never see another album like this again. Pac truly outdid himself [and his competition] with this masterpiece. This is as close to flawless as an album can get."	2002-12-24

Perhaps I was oblivipus my first time out, perhaps TNT cut portions, or perhaps it really is that myriad.<BR>There is so much that can be said about detail in this film, tiny little cues that spin your perception of the story in wholly different directions than it has ever gone before.<BR>The elated grin on Star's face as she presses against David in the race scene, the tiny scrap of Beauty Has Her Way as the black clad vampire leader watches her return to him, and even the Echo and the Bunnymen poster on Sam's wall (not to mentions millions of other tiny details) all aid in a new sense of scope as slowly you take them in.<br />What's more, there are the upper, superficial layers of the film to revel in.  Just sit back and relax while the abject sillyness of the Coreys makes your gut hurt with suppressed laughter, enjoy the (apparent) absolute mindlessness of the fight scene, and try not to be nauseated during the feeding(unrealistic? yes.  evocative of more gory images?  also yes.)<br />The last (I swear, the last) comment I absolutely must make follows:<BR>The Lost Boys is an incredibly easy movie to feel.  Not that it is emotionally trying in any real way, bt in that there is something more than tangible, perhaps even more than visceral about the film.  The plot is believable, not in that I believe in the supernatural, but that in many (if not all:  note the Frog brothers) of the characters respond to stimuli presented in such an absolutely honest way that it worries one.  Are there vampires right down the block?  The howling motorcycles, the missing persons flyers, the predominance of odd people in my neighbourhood - am I living in an haven for the undead?  Even the most rational people could easily find themselves looking over their shoulders when walking the dog after dark.  Especially people who live as close to Greenwich Village as I do, pardon the phrasing but that place must be crawling with vamps!	2003-02-02

WHY? Because the NOW is NEVER good enough. There's still something out there that can make you make happy, or more happy; some future insight, event, book, course, seminar, experience, person, whatever. This is our suffering. Everything we want belongs to the FUTURE; everything we have is in the NOW. The two are unbridgeable. Between the two is the gap where we suffer. Can you honestly say you do not suffer, that you are not grasping, hoping, expecting, clinging, wanting or needing something to change your life for the better? Even if we feel happy, we still need to tweak our lives until it's better still. Mr Tolle shows us that these are all mind games, that once we go someway toward understanding the nature of mind, we understand not only ourselves and our problems a little better, but the whole world and all its problems, because the whole world is simply a mirror of you and me. I am the world multiplied six billion times. It is nothing but a huge projection of myself. The world does not exist outside of our minds.<br />All the masters and mystics say the same thing for sure, but Mr Tolle, for me anyway, is one of the most articulate. Although having spent a little while on the journey to freedom, this book opened up new levels of understanding which I hand't grasped before from other sources. Do not be fooled by its simplicity. You don't know anything until you \\\\\"know\\\\\" existentially. As I read this book more and more, I am realizing I know less and less. This is what this book can do for you - empy your mind of past conditionings. It's that good! <br />Other excellent books you might want to check out that perhaps for me layed the grounding in understanding this book are: \\\\\"Loving What Is\\\\\" by Byron Katie, and \\\\\"Nothing\\\\\" by Jim Sloman, found on Mayyoubehappy.com. Check out Osho too for his immense clarity on every subject under the sun. Ignore the controversy, focus on his wisdom."	2003-06-18

Let me emphasize something right from the start: 3-stars is not indicative of my feelings towards the music contained on this set. Ziggy is a classic album, and deserves that status. In fact, in deserves far more than is offered in this poorly planned, shoddy two-disc \\\\\"30th Anniversary Edition\\\\\" offered from EMI.<br />Ziggy Stardust has been reissued countless times on CD in the past 15 years. In fact, let's take an inventory. There was the original, from-second-generation-tapes-but-unprocessed RCA disc that's currently having something of a critical renaissance. There was the original Rykodisc issue which came with bonus tracks. There was the anniversary Ryko box, with the same disc but a great box/booklet (far nicer than the one in this 30th Anniversary volume, and packaged much better to boot). Then there was the gold, Au20 series disc issued by Rykodisc (remastered again), and then in 1999 the Virgin reissue of the disc, which deleted the bonus tracks. And then this. While not publicized quite as much, it seems as if David might be competing with Hendrix or Elvis for \\\\\"most endlessly reissued album\\\\\" in this particular case.<br />So, uh, what do we have here, then? Well, we've got a two-disc set, held together by some *very* fragile packaging (the booklet seems almost designed to fall apart!). The main set is remastered again (although not very well...we'll get to that in a moment), and is supplemented by a second disc of bonus tracks.<br />Unfortunately, the iteration of \\\\\"Ziggy\\\\\" here is, I dare to say, the worst version on CD. The sound is slightly muddier than the already-overcompressed Virgin CD, but that isn't the main problem. What *is* a problem is the fact that the stereo channels of the album are reversed and intros to two songs (the acoustic segue between Ziggy and Suffragette City and the count-in to Hang On To Yourself) are missing. Missing. Inexcusable, and it's unfathomable that of all issues of the album, it's the \\\\\"milestone\\\\\" 30th anniversary set that's botched. <br />And the bonus tracks? Not only could they fit on the first disc--which, in current record company logic, would probably knock the price down a few notches--they've almost all been released before, mostly on the Ryko edition. There's nothing revelatory here, and although it's certainly nice to have these selections in print again, one must wonder why more effort wasn't expended in getting some nice, *really* never-been-heard-before vault tracks.<br />The verdict? If you absolutely, positively have never heard Ziggy before...well, don't buy this, as it's the only version on disc to actually make mistakes representing the original work. Track down the Ryko editions if you want bonus tracks, or grab the single-disc version (which really isn't all that bad) or--gasp--the RCA if you're so inclined. This set is for collectors, plain and simple."	2003-07-04

The mood is just as it should be, somber but not too sad, and the filming is excellent.  The movie is mostly in earthy camouflage colors, greens and yellows and browns.  The stunts and special effects are all realistic.  The soundtrack is also very fitting, sounding very eerie in the sad parts.  The acting is all superb, even that of minor characters.  The sense of camaraderie between soldiers is portrayed well.<br />This movie is too gory for children to watch, or those who dislike seeing gore or violence, but I enjoyed it, so I would recommend it even for those, like me, who don't normally like war movies.  I don't really know how it compares to other war films since I haven't seen many, but it is a good movie and my guess is that it ranks on up there.	2003-08-02

No one's going to get an argument from me if they say that there are several moments on here that could've been dispensed with. Steve Stills entire &quot;49 Bye-Byes/America's Children&quot; noise rant sounded stupid back then and still does (and I LIKE Stills!)and the &quot;electric&quot; portion of this set never quite catches fire. But with the exception of Still's solo moment, the entire first disc is a winner. Crosby's &quot;Lee Shore&quot; remain's captivating after all this time and the addition of Stills' &quot;Black Queen&quot; to this release gains back some of the ground Stills lost with &quot;49 Bye-Byes.&quot; Neil Young's contributions remain the strongest here, both in his solo sections and when the four team up on the Buffalo Springfield-era &quot;On The Way Home.&quot; The addition of Nash's &quot;King Midas In Reverse&quot; serves as a good reminder that Nash is not always the lightweight he appears--the version here is a winner.<br />This is not a great live album, but it has its moments and that's enough.	2003-11-26

However, throughout their debut Turn On the Bright Lights, there is a constant pulsating rhythm. By the far the chilliest (in fact downright creepiest) of the year, it builds an atmosphere of doom throughout the entire LP. Singer Paul Banks possesses a gothic wail at times evocative of what U2's Bono would sound like on downers and he uses it to majestic effect. On album highlight \\\\\"Obstacle 1,\\\\\" he exhibits a constant swagger until one line cracks his facade - \\\\\"she's bad,\\\\\" he suddenly whimpers, his voice cracking under the strain. It is not clear at all what the lyrics symbolize on the album, although they clearly mean quite a bit to Banks. It must be said, however, that it will be years before we can finally decipher the line \\\\\"The subway, she is a porno.\\\\\" <BR>One thing that Interpol posses which, at this point, Liars seem to lack is a sense of restraint. In fact, almost every song is delivered with a chilly detachment. But while when utilized by other artists (ooh, say Dido), this detachment can make the music unbearably smug and unlistenable, Interpol use this effect to create a constant feeling of internal catharsis, Banks clearly unsure of whether he despises life or loves it. <BR>There are moments, however, when this chilliness melts away. \\\\\"Say Hello to the Angels\\\\\" is an oddly exciting stomper in its own way. Possessing a drum and bass style similar to that of prime late 80s Madchester (think Stone Roses without the dance influence), it's the only song that will make you pogo around the room. And this is great, because Interpol realize that they don't have to resort to loud tactics to get you to love their album - they've read up on their rock history, and they know that invariably it's song writing that wins the day. <BR>Another classic moment on the album comes with \\\\\"NYC,\\\\\" which sets up a musical backdrop ofsweeping, chiming guitars and rolling drums to create a rhythm which is both beautiful and unsettling. Soon afterwards, Banks enters and sets forth a tale of being alienated in the big city which all of us can surely relate to. Finally, he enters the heart-tugging chorus of \\\\\"New York cares - got to be some more change in my life,\\\\\" crystalizing the bipolar double standard which characterizes the rest of the album. <BR>So in the end, there can only be one. And frankly, it's not hard. Because while Liars have the funk, Interpol have the songs - and in the end, that's all it really comes down to. This may not be for long - with this genre spreading wider than anyone could have expected, there are more great punk-funk bands (ie LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture, Radio 4) springing up each day. For now, however, Interpol are the kings."	2004-01-30

It is so boring to hear a musical artist that sounds exactly the same on every one of their albums.

Full of portentious music and camera angles, The Insider plays like a story that is about to reveal a mystical, transforming truth, or at least something shocking.  But that's the problem.  The movie isn't about a network news show cow-towing to financial pressures.  Sure, that story is here, but it never becomes the major focus of the film.  And the movie isn't about one man and his crisis of conscience or character.  Again, we are shown the thin, superficial layers of this personal struggle, but not much more.  Instead, the movie drills into, and focuses on relentlessly, the &quot;secret&quot; this &quot;insider&quot; wants to tell the world, but can't.  And that point is driven home in so many different ways--as if Jeffrey Wygand (who I suppose is the main character) has something extraordinarily interesting and devastating to reveal, and that the world will change as a result of him going public.<br />That's the tragedy of The Insider.  Because now, a few years of perspective later, we realize that Wygand's inside story is both obvious and relatively unimportant.  Sure, it caused some big tobacco settlements to be struck, but it packs relatively little dramatic punch.  And so all this pomp and circumstance about his revelations and their impact on society at large has no legs.  And the loud, pretentious soundtrack, the slow motion effects, the bombastic set-up, well, it's a set-up for disappointment. It's a bit like setting your home movies to a Wagnerian opera.<br />I gave the movie a three because I thought Pacino's and Plummer's performances, and to a slightly lesser extent, Crowe's, merited it.  Plus, being inside the conflict within CBS was fascinating.	2004-04-28

In The Mood for Love is great art.  Film romance in America recalls films like Casablanca or Gone With The Wind.  Bogart and Bergman cannot consummate their great love.  Brett and Scarlet can consummate, but the love part is tricky for Scarlet.  What I think I'm trying to say, everyone with a modest love life has fallen for that special someone that got away.  For the American audience, the resulting hurt is gripping in story or film.  We mourn lost love.  Well, the Chinese director Wong Kat-wai's gives us a Buddhist version of lost love.  It resembles mourning.   <br /> <br />The lovers have cheating spouses in common and a common hallway to their apartments.  Their relationship is maddening.  It is a platonic relationship despite the fact that they are very warm, attractive people. Indeed, Maggie Cheung is sultry hot in silk slit dresses with long legs and 1962 stiletto heels.  They vow not to be like their cheating spouses, but before long they are in desperate need of each other, but their previous declarations takes precedence. <br /> <br />The story is painted.  Think Toulouse-Lautrec meets Gauguin in Hong Kong.  The colors are dazzling and the scene set-ups are all about the artist's eye.  What was that Charles De Gaulle scene in Cambodia at the end of the movie?  What's with the Buddhist Temple as a Notre Dame Cathedral in Cambodia?  I can't be sure.  Perhaps it's Buddhist sophisms.  This film is not for fans of American romance, so be forewarned, but it is an exotic and fine piece of art. <br />	2004-11-26

If you enjoyed this movie, there is a good chance you have an undiagnosed mental illness. There are so many things wrong about it that I almost don't know where to start but the main thing that stands out for me was the fact that it only deals with two or three days out of Christ's life, and assumes that the viewer knows all there is to know about what came before his arrest, trial, torture, and execution. The graphic scenes of brutality and violence are blatantly gratuitous and I still as yet have no idea what Mel wanted me to think or feel as a result of seeing this, and honestly - I don't really want to know. He could have made a movie about the life and works of Jesus of Nazareth...gone into his teachings, his message of hope but instead we get to see Him turned into bloody hamburger by the end of the movie. Gee, I hope that didn't spoil the ending for you if you haven't seen it yet. In summary, this movie was DISGUSTING. And a sure sign that we are in The End of Days...	2005-05-22

The year was 1962. Inside the CD booklet, the pictures reveal a slightly awkward looking Dylan who doesn't quite exude the confidence that inexorably burgeoned approximately a year later (compare these photos with the photos included in the remasters of \\\\\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\\\\"). And who can blame him for possibly feeling a little out of place? The great John Hammond had just discovered him playing in clubs such as the Gaslight in Greenwich Village (Hammond also discovered such indispensable names as Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, and others). Suddenly (he left Minnesota for New York around 1959) Dylan finds himself in a Columbia records recording studio. Not only that, he's recording two of his own compositions.<br /><br />Though the young Dylan might look a little awkward here, he by no means sounds awkward. The now 42 year old pictures belie the extreme confidence and \\\\\"wise beyond his years\\\\\" mood that pervades his first album. Dylan was only 20 at the time. Nonetheless, the songs about death and sorrow carry a mood of experience and feeling that most 20 year olds probably can't imagine. Dylan grunts and strains in \\\\\"In My Time of Dying\\\\\" (a traditional blues number sometimes attributed to Blind Willie Johnson and sometimes credited as just 'traditional') and \\\\\"Fixin' To Die\\\\\" (by \\\\\"Bukka\\\\\" White - another blues singer that lived the blues) as though the issue has direct immediacy for him. And the great closer \\\\\"See that my Grave Is Kept Clean\\\\\" (by the legendary Blind Lemon Jefferson - another man who lived the blues) carries a similar impact. At times, Dylan's voice takes on a harsher growl here than on any of his subsequent albums (listen to the songs above as well as \\\\\"Highway 51 Blues\\\\\", \\\\\"Gospel Plow\\\\\", and \\\\\"House of the Risin' Sun\\\\\" for more examples). Songs such as \\\\\"Talkin' New York\\\\\" - the album's funniest song with original lyrics by Dylan - and \\\\\"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down\\\\\" point to the Dylan that emerges on 1963's \\\\\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\\\\". Dylan began to evolve even on his first album.<br /><br />The Dylan original, \\\\\"Song To Woody\\\\\", shows Dylan's great promise as a songwriter, but it does pale a little in comparison to his output of 1963. In fact, very little on this album, great as it is, points to the Dylan that we know over 40 years later as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Had Dylan ceased recording after this album he would've remained an interesting, and probably obscure, footnote in folk music history. Had he stopped recording after \\\\\"Freewheelin'\\\\\" he would probably still be remembered as somewhat of a legend. In fact, the transition from this album to its successor is startling and shows an evolution and progression probably unmatched in popular music history. In his \\\\\"Chronicles, Vol. 1\\\\\" Dylan even expressed some surprise at what happened. At the time he said the only thing of any significance he had written was \\\\\"Song To Woody\\\\\". That soon changed.<br /><br />Dylan's first album is a great listen. The long overdue remastering sounds incredible. It has also likely exposed many people to great blues and folk classics. It probably also fueled the young Dylan with the confidence and assurance to go on to write timeless songs such as \\\\\"Blowin' in the Wind\\\\\", \\\\\"Masters of War\\\\\", and \\\\\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\\\\".

Steinman Has To Be An Idiot Savant	"I mean...an EXPLICT sequel to one of the greatest selling albums of all time. Impossibly long running time, not only over all, but just the entire damn thing. It's almost impalaple on first listen. I Would Do Anything For Love is TWELVE minutes long! (bet you didn't learn that in music class?)And Todd Rundgren only plays guitar he does not arrange... uh oh. Steinman pushes everything to the point of excess every single chance he gets. not once does he ever show one single trace of good taste, as his arrangments are usually very busy, playing not so great melodies over top of meat loaf's technically demanding, but over emoting singing, to lyrics that make 12 year olds blush with their immaturity. The music is a mix of that FIRST album with slight nods to contemporary trends. This is a nightmare of an album that is absolutely a joy to listen to because of it. <br />It's like, this is the ultimate in excess trash. It's garbage, there's nothing here emotionally or musically. It's all derviative and technically should never have gained any popularity at all. <br />But the fun of the album is the complete trash nature of the album. And the fact that everybody knows it is. You can't convince me Steinman was insane enough to take \\\\\"wasted youth\\\\\" seriously; it's a joke. I believe the man is serious in what he is doing, but he also knows that there is an inherently ridiculously quality not only to his music but to rock and roll in general. <br />So, he pushes everything that is excess to the complete breaking point, breaking it constantly. He probably giggled his way through these sessions. And Meat Loaf no doubt did the same. Oh not to disparage him completely, the man has tons of talent. I mean, there is a lot of stuff going on in every one of these songs, and rarely rarely do they seem tossed together. He carefully crafts these songs, like a broadway tunesmith, hoping you'll all clap along and sing to his merry melodies. Love it, leave it, I don't care. I listen to it aboutonce a year and I still remember the songs. That's all one can ask for in trash entertainment, sometimes."	2005-08-15

His co-stars Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp also contributed strong performances.    The commentary track in this set is fascinating and thoroughly enhanced my appreciation of what I already considered a masterpiece.     I can't remember if a comment I read (or maybe heard in the commentary) about Johnny was made by Thewlis or Leigh, but it was that Johnny is a character that is just a little too clever for his own good. Take the sarcastic bitter side of John Lennon without the hope and you've got a miserable man- that's Naked's Johnny all over. Although we see Johnny do some horrible things, he is also an idealist who is enraged by how far the world (and probably he himself) falls short of his expectations.     I'm glad Criterion is giving this film the presentation it deserves.	2005-08-23

"As I have said before when doing a review of a Lee Child book, I started with his most recent effort and have been working my way back since. Die Trying is the second book in the Jack Reacher series and not withstanding what some others have said about it, I found it to be very readable, highly entertaining and very good writing. <br /> <br />Other novels have been done about militia units and their paranoia.  <br /> <br />In this case, Reacher is, as he describes himself, \\\\\"an innocent bystander\\\\\" who happened to be passing a Chicago dry cleaner when Holly Johnson is exiting it with a full load of freshly pressed clothes. She is struggling with the nine hangers and trying to manage a cane as she has hurt her knee playing soccer. Reacher takes the cleaning to assist her and the next thing he knows they are surrounded by three men with guns, hustled into a car at the curb and taken away. <br /> <br />Holly is an FBI agent. She is also the daughter of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President's god-daughter.  <br /> <br />You might imagine that her kidnapping rates attention. <br /> <br />The rest of the book plays out as Holly and Reacher match wits with the militia mastermind and the government tries to deal with the kidnapping in a low profile manner. <br /> <br />I found it to be a page turner.

This body of work shows why Aretha continues to reign supreme. <br /> <br />The Queen takes on the Kings of Soul/Rhythm & Blues and pulls no punches as she  covers Ray Charles's \\\\\"Come Back Baby\\\\\" and \\\\\"Be as Good to Me as I Am to You,\\\\\"  James Brown's \\\\\"Money Won't Change You,\\\\\" and Curtis Mayfield's \\\\\"People Get Ready\\\\\".   She's classical, bluesy, funky, and right-down soulful on every cut. <br /> <br />The poet Nikki Giovanni once wrote--\\\\\"Aretha can sing Money Won't Change You, but can James Brown sing Respect?\\\\\"  In other words, when the Queen covers a song, it becomes hers and one can easily forget about the original artist.  For example, Carol King wrote and recorded \\\\\"Natural Woman\\\\\" but that song is and probably will always be associated with Aretha Franklin. <br /> <br />Aretha wails and gets right-down funky on cuts like \\\\\"Chain of Fools\\\\\" and \\\\\"Nikki Hokey.\\\\\"   She's operatically soulful on \\\\\"Ain't No Way\\\\\"--which to this day no female artist, including Whitney Houston, has been able to successfully cover.   <br /> <br />Add this CD to your collection and continue to be soulfully captivated by the one and only true Queen of Soul - Ms. Aretha Franklin. <br /> <br />"	2007-03-08

As Britain's Channel 4 reportage \\\\\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\\\\" notes CO2 lags temperature gains and losses by, on average, 800 years. Throughout history, CO2 has never been known to \\\\\"cause\\\\\" a global warming cycle. Proponents of the theory that humans are \\\\\"first\\\\\" cause for GW reluctantly admit that the CO2 to T lag is true, but CO2 exacerbates the warming with divergent feedback ... and then ultimately, somehow reverses itself ... yes it reverses itself like any cycle does. So, with that knowledge, what was the immediate cause of all of the warming and cooling cycles throughout history (cycled increases and decreases in solar activity, maybe), especially the warming, cooling and then warming cycles throughout the 1900s? Why weren't equally warm periods when Greenland wss green, wine grapes grew in abundance in England and the economies of the era appeared to prosper not catastrophic? If the cycle always reverses itself (just as the cooling cycle in the 1970s did), what is all the panic about? I have no doubt that many, if not most, in the GW industry are sincere ... but let's have a rational debate with all sides included in the debate and not dominated by the GW religious fervor that blinds reason and smothers opposing thought as though it were heresy."	2007-03-18

It's nice to see the special effects of the usual guns'n'bombs'n'cars movies in 1080p, but this series takes full advantage of the medium and uses it for something worth seeing more than once.

It's essentially a crime film but with a sly sense of humour at times and with various wonderful plot twists.  It's also quite confronting at times.  It's always entertaining.<br /><br />The film claims to be based on a true story.  The magnitude of the robbery on which it's based was greater than the Great Train Robbery.  Details were never allowed to be fully released as the crime had security implications.<br /><br />So, let me back up a bit.  A group of small time criminals gets a tip off about a bank vault where the alarms have been temporarily tuned off.  They intend to dig a tunnel from an adjacent building and steal the contents of the various safe deposit boxes.  In spite of themselves, they succeed.  The money and jewels are stolen in the heist but so too are compromising photographs of Princess Margaret and others of various cabinet ministers.  Needless to say, the photos are more valuable to some people than the money.<br /><br />Through a series of crosses and double crosses, the gang mainly but not totally succeeds.  Along the way, the plot twists and turns and the viewer is always kept guessing.  Jason Statham as the leader of the team is very convincing.  His beautiful accomplice Saffron Burrows provides some sexual tension to the story.  She is quite a revelation.<br /><br />I recommend this film without question.  The British are very good at producing a crime thriller.  Hollywood could take a few lessons.  Do yourself a favour, go and see this film.	2008-08-17

I'm on my second DVD after having contacted Warner (referred to them by BBC America) about the missing bits on the DVD as mentioned by others. Let's be clear: the omission is obvious. We're not talking a decision to take a distinct section out, it's a segment from the middle of a song that's missing. I had contacted them earlier this year and, after months of back and forth, received a replacement that I was assured fixed the problem.   It did not.  After finally being able to watch the DVD, I saw that the exact same errors were present (Gavroche and \\\\\"Little People,\\\\\" etc.). In addition. I found another problem I didn't see in my quick glance through the reviews here.    The original release of the concert was on a double-sided, double layer DVD, with Act 1 on one side, Act 2 on the second. This DVD is on a single-sided DVD. How did they do this? By atrociously high video compression. There are a lot of blacks in the concert as a result of it being performed on a stage with a darkened background. The posterization effect that results from the high compression (where the shading changes are abrupt rather than gradual) are quite glaring and distracting.    Anyway, I've contacted Warner again; their initial response was \\\\\"that's how it is,\\\\\" which is just silly.     It's a shame; I love Les Miserables, and this is truly a great version--the only way it could have been better would have been if it had been a complete version of the play.     But I'd loaned out my original DVD (the previous release) to someone who made off with it; I think it's better enough (compared to this one) that I'm going to order a replacement, despite the quite high cost."	2008-11-07

In all fairness, this should be a 2 1/2 or 3-star film, but the utterly appalling ending removes any possible enjoyment.  Many other reviews have summed up the plot, so I see no reason to restate it here. What is so ghastly about the movies' conclusion is the premise that an intelligent, well-educated, experienced SCIENTIST; upon meeting an alien species is reduced to \\\\\"faith\\\\\" to explain what happened. I was almost physically ill. Faith is the ENEMY of science. It denies reason, ignores evidence, and accepts no criticism. To suggest that a scientist would throw away logic and reason in some sort of quasi-religious epiphany is not just stupid, it's insulting.   Do not buy this. Do not watch this.   Watch Star Wars instead. It's far more entertaining, and far less insulting to your intelligence."	2009-01-12

Well acted, well written - just plain good. Unless you hate happy endings and insist that any good drama has to either end in the middle of an enigmatic scene (like most German and Japanese gay films I've seen) or in some sad, pathetic tragedy, I strongly suggest ordering Shelter immediately. It's a good lift with solid performances and quality cinematography. But most of all, it just feels so good.	2009-01-15

The only aspect keeping this from being a 4 or 5 star review is the fact that only the theatrical versions are available.  Blu-Ray is specifically made to hold a great deal more data than any prior video or DVD format. Aside from the issues regarding the new effects of the director's cut of TMP, there's little reason (other than monetary) for Paramount to hold back the extended cuts. Seamless branching, used so successfully on the TOS first season set, would work equally well here.<br /><br />The Motion Picture is another story, since the new effects were rendered for lower resolution and it will take time and, of course, money to rerender them. We can expect to see a Director's Edition release on BD in the near future, I'm sure. However, this does not excuse the lack of the inclusion of the extended TV cut put out on video.<br /><br />Having said that, it is an amazing thrill having the theatrical cuts of The Motion Picture, and The Undiscovered Country on disc for the first time ever. TUC was NEVER seen in this version since its original release and until today, I had totally forgotten how good a film it was. Many fans enjoy the additional scenes, but I always felt they brought the film down some. The scenes were obvious and amped up the silliness fact in a film that very much needed to be played straight. The two video versions really brought the maturity level of the story down some notches.<br /><br />Now, however, we once again see the film as originally released 18 years ago (oh God, it's been that long). Over the years, the film had become less enjoyable and fallen down the ranks in my personal list of favorites. None of the other had, but this one - a film I really loved in the theater - had dropped in favor. Now, having watched it again from beginning to end, I found I loved the film once more. The story is tighter and less obvious. These changes were not major, but they made an impact. This is the best movie for the cast to exit on and is once more a 4 star film to me.<br /><br />The Motion Picture: it's great to see this movie in this format again, as released without alteration. However, this film is more problematic. The extended version was just a \\\\\"longer cut\\\\\" with some great scenes added, but none of the fat trimmed (these scenes are included in the extras). The Directors Cut was better paced and more tightly edited and also added some amazing effects to cover some of the less successful work in the picture, but they also lost bits that made the film unique which weren't \\\\\"bad.\\\\\" Since there never actually was a \\\\\"perfect\\\\\" version of this film, it's vital all three versions should be made available (or maybe someone should redo the DE).<br /><br />The Wrath of Kahn: again the theatrical cut and, as we all know, this film had the full restoration, presumably because the master elements needed it badly while the other films were fine. I'll comment on picture shortly, but let's just say this is a fantastic presentation of the movie.<br /><br />Finally The Search for Spock, my favorite Trek film. For those who notice such things, the video versions always screwed up the opening credits. The VHS version had them replaced by \\\\\"video graphics\\\\\" which looked like a cheap, high school AV squad attempt to make Star Trek movie credits. The wide screen VHS and laserdiscs were much better, givings us the titles seen in the film. However, the DVDs had a \\\\\"glitched\\\\\" version of the titles, with the timing off badly. It's tough to explain, but if you compare the BD and the DVD opening credits, you'll see them. And since this is my all time favorite Trek film, one I saw in the theater 7 times and memorized with obsessive Trekkie abandon, you can imagine my thrill when I saw the BD version corrected the credits. Ahhhh! :-)<br /><br />Okay, my impression of the picture quality. There's been a lot said about the excessive digital noise reduction Paramount slathered on the films. I was expecting some bad stuff when I fired up my 52 inch HDTV. You know what I got? An amazing picture - every time. The level of sharpness and clarity to these films is a revelation! I had NEVER seen these films looking so amazingly sharp and detailed. The Wrath of Kahn, which - as noted - got the real restoration, is very nice, but I didn't notice a huge difference between this restoration and the other films. Mostly, I noticed the print was a little darker than prior prints and the other films. The blacks do hold up well on BD, better than on HD-DVD, to my surprise.<br /><br />I have read that those who watch the movies on HUGE screens will notice the DNR, I have to say that my 52 inch, which I sit 6 to 8 feet away from, does not reveal any obvious dullness. And, really, I would assume the great majority of people don't go much larger than 52 inch (unless you have a mansion and more money than God). Honestly, I have no issues with the picture quality, and can wholeheartedly give the picture a thumbs up.<br /><br />The sound is also extremely impressive. The dialog is not lost among the music and sound effects, like so many other HD presentations. The muddiness in much of Kahn and The Search for Spock is not as strong, and the music score for the films never sounded so good.<br /><br />The subtitles for various alien languages are, however, disc generated, not embedded in the films. So the \\\\\"species centric\\\\\" fonts are lost (and, I guess, really doesn't make these true theatrical cuts). However, they are not obviously bad or \\\\\"video titles\\\\\" and won't stand out to people not that familiar or who don't care.<br /><br />To sum up: the only disappointment is in the fact that there's plenty of room for all versions of the films, either side by side or through branching, so (aside from the DE of TMP), there's no reason to have left them out. Having all versions would justify the price tag of this double or triple dip. Especially since you know Paramount will release these again with these versions included.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a great set. The theatrical cuts are the versions I fell in love with and it's great to have them back. The picture is outstanding, with refreshing sharpness and clarity, while the sound mix is comfortable and satisfying.<br /><br />5 stars for the presentation<br />Subtract 2 stars for leaving out the alternate versions.<br /><br />For fans of the original cuts, this is an essential set. It's up to you to decide if you want to hold out for the next and probably more complete release of these films.bad stuff when I fired up my 52 inch HDTV. You know what I got?

It all seemed like too much effort...crisis cards...super crisis cards...Raiders...Heavy Raiders...etcetera. There are many small ships to keep track of and many cardboard pieces which don't always hold up so well after multiple games.   But don't let that stop you. This game is worth the effort.  Since I am a big fan of the \\\\\"Battlestar Galactica\\\\\" TV show, I didn't give up on the game and I played the it at a local gaming convention. And I had a blast!  The Battlestar Galactica board game is complex and time consuming and deals with some adult themes, so I wouldn't recommend it for kids (especially those with short attention spans).  The goal of the game is for the Human fleet to reach the planet Kobol by making FTL (faster than light) \\\\\"jumps\\\\\" through hazardous territory. The Cylons want to prevent this from happening by destroying the Battlestar Galactica or running the Humans out of their four main resources (food, fuel, morale and population) through military attacks and exploiting the mandatory crisis posed to the fleet each turn.  Yes, you'll need at least three hours (give or take) for a game of BSG, but the time spent is worth it, if you ask me.  Yes, making the switch to this kind of complex, adult oriented game isn't easy at first for people who play Parker Brothers board games regularly.  Yes, you will have more fun playing BSG with three or more people. But there are two player and solo rules on the game's web site. I've had fun playing by myself, which (to me) is the sign of a good board game.  Yes, you may get the chance to play as a Cylon and attempt to destroy humanity. Any character being played can be a Cylon, not just the ones who turned out to be such in the TV show. The element of paranoia between the players is a significant element of the game--one which increases with the number of players in the game.  No, everything in the game does not follow the logic set down by the TV show. For example, no character can fly Raptors in the game (Raptors are risked in various card based situations, they don't enter into combat), not even Boomer and Helo who are characters in the TV show who only fly Raptors.  No, it's not easy to be the Humans once a Cylon player is revealed. But that's the point. Human players have to work together to find out which player is a hidden Cylon--while resolving a new crisis every turn, plus Cylon fleet attacks--and then work even harder to fight off the revealed Cylon's determined efforts to destroy humanity.  Yes, each of the main Human (and one Cylon) characters from the first season of the TV show is represented in the game. My favorites are Baltar and Tigh, though Adama and Roslin are great in larger games. And the allure of jumping into a Viper and blasting Cylon Raiders as Apollo or Starbuck is strong.  Yes, Fantasy Flight Games is due to release the Pegasus expansion (in Fall 2009) to the Battlestar Galactica board game, which carries the game through the beginning of season 3 of the TV series.  Whether you like the TV show or hate it, I hope you try and enjoy the Battlestar Galactica board game if what I've written above sounds at all interesting to you."	2009-08-11

Reading the other reviews made me not want to read this book. Everyone kept saying comments like \\\\\"jumped the shark.\\\\\" I know that this book tends to reach out to young adults, and maybe many of these people want unresolved drama and death. If that is what you are looking for in an ending, this not the book the read. Meyer is trying to show how through love and cooperation, with her vivid characters, that you can overcome things and have that happy ending. I do not understand why some people would rudely return a book that they had read, or wish for Jacob's death. If that is what you are hoping for, then do not read this book. Meyer ends this on a good note with finality and demonstrating the importance of family. Maybe you would have to experience what it is like to not have a family and then become part of one in order to feel the meaning of this book. She somehow ties up all the loose ends and brings a great ending to this saga. I highly recommend this book, despite the other reviewers. I noticed that the older audience (greater than 20 years old) tends to enjoy this ending more than the younger audience. Maybe there is an understanding that dramatic writing does not need to end with a horrible dramatic finish in order to still have a good ending. Meyer weaves in drama throughout her book to keep you reading, while also bringing a finality to these books. I have read a lot of books before, and people write in their reviews of this book that some of these events are ridiculous. Have you ever thought of vampires and werewolves as ridiculous? These books are fiction. These are not real characters."	2009-11-12

I talk too much!:  Before the long wind begins, I will say I did enjoy this film. It did indeed entertain me. The problem always comes with the noisy ruminations of its enthusiastic appreciators.I think that I could get with the prevailing assessment of the \\\\\"greatness\\\\\" of this film if there was a modicum of respect for the art that came before it. Like battlestar galactica, like star wars, like the recent installments of superman and batman (the slightly older newer batman - being batman begins actually - coming less than a full decade after the old incarnation) the passionate contemporary blows the loudest horn. The words \\\\\"Younger\\\\\" and \\\\\"better\\\\\", the word \\\\\"sexier\\\\\", the ill gotten word \\\\\"hipper\\\\\" are thrown around as justifications of the product's existence altogether. It's the hip sexiness that makes this new such and such a thousand times better than the old so and so. As if there were any better reason for sprucing up and old car or an old house, than the time honored pursuit of long green! New Money making marketeer barons would have us believe the fairytale that this new re-imagination trend of updating the old was the obligation of the young. It is not, as a matter of fact, to anyone listening, it is not not not! But this is the parlance they use, and no one asks..., yeah but... WHY? Why did it HAVE to happen? It didn't. The suits just thought they could make a buck off something. Yes yes, a built in audience! Excellent marketing savvy there, gentlemen, although if you proceed to change everything in order to make it \\\\\"digest-able\\\\\" to the A.D.D. in you and me, then aren't they effectively alienating those same supposedly built in devotees? Tis indeed a conundrum!     Hubris:  And how does this attitude of better come into the equation. This is such a throw away society that we have television shows that are dedicated to mocking the times and styles of decades past with amusingly clever video blubs and pop up commentary atop stock footage of Wham or the Beatles or President Kennedy and everyone giggles about hair styles and artsy gimmickry. However they're clearly oblivious to the fact that in time the right now will be the back then, and brand new snotties in hipster gear of tomorrow year will be mocking them just as vehemently and thinking themselves just as clever. Comparing the old Battlestar Galactica or Star trek to the new is ridiculously naïve and downright stupid. Of course with the benefit of 20 to 30 years of advancement the look of one thing from now will out shine the lack of gloss of the one thing then. No one looks at photography and says that they're modern Polaroid of their dog, or the digital download of their children in a playground are \\\\\"BETTER\\\\\" than old picture candids of grandma from 1947, it's the substance of the photo, not the quality of the make of the picture. I mean, That argument would be friggin' stupid, wouldn't it?!!! The special effects are a thousand times better, the look is crisper, the visuals stunning. So let that be written down, we all agree. But sorry kids, I can still separate pretty from nourishing. Just a plain pretty look and nothing much in the story department is the equivalent of empty calories. Something to think about.     About the film itself:  For something so new and improved we sure did manage to roll out the Sci Fi cliché machine front and center when we were jotting this three act extravaganza down on paper, didn't we?     MR.BRAIN: Well... first we need a villain, he should be deep and brooding and virtually wordless so we don't have any of those clichéd cartoon mustache twisting villain moments.   MR. PINKY: How can we make him menacing if n' he don't talk, though, boss?  MR.BRAIN: Easy, we'll put sinister looking tattoos all over his face and give him nasty looking serrated edged weapons he can use to slay hapless Starfleet officers!  MR. PINKY: Brilliant, sir! What do we call him?  MR.BRAIN: Darth Maul!  MR. PINKY: Uhh, sir? Seriously?  MR.BRAIN: Yeah you're right, that's been taken. Alright well Roddenberry templated the Romulans against the Romans, roll out the list of roman emperors, drop your finger on a name and let's just move on, ANYTHING BUT CAESAR! That's too obvious.   MR. PINKY: Of course, sir.   MR.BRAIN: Now we don't want Darth Maul...  MR. PINKY: Sir?!  MR.BRAIN: I mean Nero, to be one dimensional, do we? So we'll have to give him purpose, alright, I say page two paragraph six of the vile motivations handbook?  MR. PINKY: Dead wife, sir?  MR.BRAIN: Yes! It worked for Mr. Freeze, didn't it? But lets up the anti_ his whole planet's destroyed and so now he wants to destroy the federation.  MR. PINKY: So the federation destroyed his planet?  MR.BRAIN: Nahh, but we'll come up with some convoluted plot point that'll wrap that all up.  MR. PINKY: How's he try to destroy the federation, sir, Sabotage? Political intrigue?  MR.BRAIN: Are you nuts, that would take whole minutes to establish, and mostly done through dialog! Go to chapter one in the Vile Implementations handbook.  MR. PINKY: Oh sir, you don't mean....?  MR.BRAIN: Yes my friend, the vaunted planet destroying weapon!  MR. PINKY: Didn't we do that with V-Ger in the first film Kahn and the genesis device, or the hunchback whale probe, or with that weirdo nexus ribbon that required the destruction or worlds to be moved, or when that guy who killed Mozart needed a face lift and was willing to use some solar collector thingie on a planet, or that OTHER Romulan dude, Shinzon or whatever, didn't he have a super baddie weapon he planned to use against the federation? And didn't Vader have like two of those types of things?  MR.BRAIN: Your point? It works, don't it?     MR. PINKY: Alright, so we got the federation against a rogue madman with his very own planet destroying weapon and an axe to grind?  MR.BRAIN: Sounds like Gold, don't it?  MR. PINKY: But neither Romulos nor Vulcan were destroyed in Kirks time of star trek, sir, how do we fit this in?  MR.BRAIN: C'mon, use you head willya, Mirror mirror on the wall!  MR. PINKY: Ohh of course sir, an alternate universe! Meaning Nero's a time traveler! The sci Fi trifecta, you are an absolute genius of modern celluloid story crafting, sir.  MR.BRAIN: Yes, yes, you're quite right! Alright my nephew'll be getting home from high school any minute; I get him working on the script as soon as he puts the key in the door!    Get you-self an edu-ma-cation, son:  Sadly I must admit to a prejudice myself, toward these greasy new executive hipsters whom blow in, un-time-tested, with one or two hits under their belt and now suddenly their some prodigy that knows better than everyone. I mean, at first I sort of buy into it cause I saw the flick and didn't vomit so I ran out and snatched up the DVD. Then suddenly you hear it, you hear it right there on the special features. \\\\\"I really wanted to make star trek more like star wars! Fast paced and not so heady.\\\\\" Fair enough, you wanted one classic space opera to be more like another classic space opera more so than you wanted it to be like itself. Alright, knowing you boys the way I do that almost makes some sense. But then they keep talking and you hear things from their own lips like, \\\\\"we took this out because it was too Set-up-ee.\\\\\" And allowing the vocab felony just committed by the word `Set-up-ee', you think; alright, the hipster's panicked that his excuse for dialog is going on too long between explosions. So out comes potentially pertinent information for the sake expediency. (them film jockeys call this \\\\\"pacing\\\\\") You keep moving. Then you get like a twelve and a half minute featurette showing you how the crafty crafters stationed a man just within camera shot so he could shine a flashlight into the lens and give everything a glaring effect. And you go. Well alright, this is sorta like movie magic, I guess, and it...is...worthy of a....full...featurette...........Right? then they talk about the director and the praise his wisdomand how good he is at turning water to wine and making the sick well and the blind see and all that, and then he comes on the scene and claims absolute stupidity, saying he was never a fan of the original trek, he never watched the show, but he had some GREAT IDEAS when they handed the project to him! So now you're like, alright, well.... So the guy's not a fan and... WAIT, WHY THE HELL IS HE MAKING THIS DAMNED MOVIE THEN? And why does an obviously smart man whom makes A-list movies feel compelled to completely downplay his wit in order to put butts in the seats? Has this society become so cynical and paranoid and functionally illiterate that we are dismayed by even the indication of a higher intellect behind our entertainment, or running our COUNTRY?! Are we at a point where a smart man has to play dumb or keep his street credibility and be taken semi seriously on the internet machine? All be told, allowing for Abrams to come out and claim a willful lack of education for himself and also of the genre he's just reinvented, harkens to the new trend of the hapless hero whom is seemingly brilliant by divine intervention and never had to work for his wit or his talents like everyone else. This new Kirk in the movie is a snot nosed kid, subversive and compulsive and reckless, yet someone sees potential in him and urges him to sign up. He even cheats, breaks all the rules and though Spock is a commander while he's still a cadet he is suddenly elevated to captain on his first mission, rising past Spock and a host of others whom I must assume have all been in Starfleet longer and whom presumably did so without faking out the system. I know the original Kirk cheated at the Kobyashi test, but you never get the impression that this was anything more than just an adherence to his own personal ideology that he didn't believe in the no win scenario. The way this is depicted, without any example of otherwise academic achievement on Chris Pines' (his character, not him, I think the dudes a whip ;)) part, we imply that he just got there on the merits of being ballsy and cheating his way through it. Someone should really have a problem with their heroes being depicted this way, but I don't think people were compelled to pay that much attention to the light lunch of characterization they were being spoon fed with sugary visuals! Hmmmmm, wait a minute.... was this Kirk quark a little autobiographical license there by the young upstart in the director's chair? Coincidence? Nahhh!     All put together I began to think to yourself, DID REALLY I JUST FRICKEN SEE AND HEAR WHAT I THOUGHT I SAW AND HEARD? And thus the intellect crusades begin. And there I go off wondering, is it not more important to inspire those still un-jaded and inspirables to CREATING something new?!    Technicality peeves:  Oh and Warp Nacelles are not thrusters, guys. The point is that they WARP space and propel the ship faster than light. They're not Jet afterburners! FYI. There have been literally a zillion tech manuals written on the Trek science, whereas you might think that these details are ridiculous, remember you're making a star trek movie! Don't talk to me about being a geek, you're the head geek in charge now, Mister mister! Can we get a guy that knows a guy to work on getting a guy to work on that? Also, who jettisons a cadet from their ship to a Hoth just because there's a slight disagreement? Doesn't the new flag ship have a brig? Oh, what? Oh, they needed to do that so young Kirk could meet old Spock and Scotty so that act 2 could begin? I see, uhhh.... Alright.... I guess. ;)  BUT I DIGRESS!      Wrap it up!:  My point is for this film and its fans; it could not have been without the original. Mr. Abrams, for all his genuine brilliance, could not have done this without firmly standing on the shoulders of Mr. Roddenberry, without taking from a wealth of pre-established minutia that allowed him the luxury of picking and choosing and then casting the aforementioned\\\\\"New Spin\\\\\". What I fail to understand in this great society of ours is, why does anything new that happens to also be good, have to be good at the expense of what came before? Why does this have to be BETTER? Why would we mock he original actors and what they did and what they left us? I mean, remember acting, folks. True the Shat-inator was over-exuberant from time to time...to time, but there was genuine conveyance of wit and both intellect and emotion from these highly capable people. We're mocking that against modern characteristic development? Are you serious? I think it would be easier to agree that it was a fast paced, enjoyable film that allowed new perspectives and new directions to be taken with old favorites if there wasn't automatically this seeming inescapable negative slant against the old for the exaltation of the new. The new is pretty, the new is newer, stylized and kinetically meeting the manic short attention span standards of the eyes of today. It has not been proven, it has not been weighed or time tested at the moment, it should be given a chance, but exaltation waits until exaltation is earned. As we have clearly learned with the original trek movies, and the new star wars, and even the new dune novels, NOTHING IS AN ABSOLUTE WIN.     I liked the film, I liked it a lot. I want more of this, but I want substance with it too, and I am harsh because I can see the trend trending away from weight and further and further towards fluff, toward \\\\\"easy\\\\\". Visuals are easy. I can think of a visual: a giant octopus wrapped tight around the empire state building, swatting battle ships out of the river while whistling the star spangled banner!: doesn't make that visual compelling or intriguing, (well kinda...) it's just a visual! It's not the film; it's the new ideological hubris I feel it represents.         And.....................breath..."	2010-01-12

The type of book you allow yourself to keep reading despite the average writing style because the story is a 'page-turner'.

But that's not the only reason that the book is considered \\\\\"the classic\\\\\" treatment of the C language. How often do you get a definitive treatment of a language by the folks who designed it? (And yes, I am aware of the Stroustrup/C++ connection). I had a well-used copy of the original edition on my bookshelf for years.    But, while it may be definitive, it is not the best reference or language tutorial for non-programmers, or maybe even for programmers coming from other languages, who want to learn C.  For that, try Stephan Kochan's \\\\\"Programming in C\\\\\". And Sam Harbison's \\\\\"C, A Reference Manual\\\\\" is where I start looking for nit-picky points of using the language."	2010-12-12

"Like I said in title, if Appetite For Destruction would add a bonus CD, adding songs that were possible to be on Appetite For Destruction, these songs would be on that CD. Even though I said \\\\\"Just some....\\\\\" doesn't mean it is not good, actually, I find it's better than the Use Your Illusion Albums. Just for your information, Rose stated that he didn't like how he sounded on the album because his voice sounded rough around the edges (for example, the album has the song \\\\\"Move to the City\\\\\" which Rose's voice sounds like on \\\\\"You Could Be Mine\\\\\" from Use Your Illusion II).        The first half of the album (The A-Side of the album if using cassette tape or Vinyl) is live, while the other half (or B-Side) is acoustic. The first track on the album is a song called \\\\\"Reckless Life\\\\\" which believe it or not, was the first song written by the band, being written around 1979-1981. The song starts out with an explicit shout out, but the rest of the song is not explicit. The second track is \\\\\"Nice Boys\\\\\", a cover that was originally by Rose Tattoo. The third track is \\\\\"Move to the City\\\\\", with Rose saying an explicit line a few times. The fourth track is \\\\\"Mama Kin\\\\\" a song originally by Aerosmith. The fifth track is an acoustic love song, called \\\\\"Patience\\\\\". It has some of the most beautiful lyrics I ever heard. The sixth track is a song called \\\\\"Used To Love Her\\\\\". The song is a joke about Rose's dog (stating, \\\\\"I used to Love her, but I had to kill her. I knew I'd miss her, now she's buried right in my backyard). The seventh track \\\\\"You're Crazy\\\\\" (originally known from Appetite For Destruction in it's faster form) is acoustic, even though it was performed with electric guitars on Appetite For Destruction, it was originally attended to be an acoustic song, like it is on here. The eighth and last track on the album is \\\\\"One in a Million\\\\\", a one of many songs that shows how talented Axl Rose is at writing songs. It is a very beautiful song and a very offensive song at the same time. My favorite thing about this song is that, at the end, Rose states how he is not perfect, and telling people they should accept themselves for who they are, that everyone is perfect in their own way (the lyrics, \\\\\"You're One in a Million, that's what you are. You're One in a Million babe, you're a shooting star. Maybe someday we'll see you, before you make us cry. You know we tried to reach you, but you were much too high.\\\\\" and \\\\\"Some say I'm lazy, some say that's just me. Some may think I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be\\\\\"). A great album, and I recommend for you to buy it."	2010-12-18

He was born in the eleven by eleven foot space and has never set foot outside of it. His Ma was kidnapped by Old Nick seven years ago and has been held captive in Room ever since. Ma has worked hard to make sure that Jack doesn't suspect that Room is a prison but she doesn't know how much longer she can take being held hostage.<br /><br />This book was wonderful for so many reasons. I will admit when my book club chose it for one of our monthly selections, I was not looking forward to reading it. Since having kids of my own, I don't have much of a stomach for reading books in which bad things happen to children. Room pleasantly surprised me - as far as Jack is concerned being in Room is not all that bad. Because it's all he's ever known and Ma has carefully sheltered him from knowledge of the outside world, he's actually a pretty happy child. There are definitely some parts of the book that are tough to read but it wasn't as wrenching as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I really appreciated the attention to detail the author had when writing this book. She actually had her brother-in-law design a scale CAD design of Room and all its furnishings so that she could get an accurate feel for what living in an eleven by eleven room would be like. You can find this design on her website. She did a great job of realizing the many aspects of Jack's development that would be affected by growing up in Room - physical, emotional and intellectual. He was affected in ways I never would have considered myself but that made total sense.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of hearing Ms. Donoghue speak at an event put on by my local independent bookstore, Rainy Day Books. I can't really get into what she talked about too much because it would spoil the story but it definitely added to my enjoyment of the book to know why she made the choices she did with the direction the plot went and with the way characters were portrayed.<br /><br />This book led to one of the most robust book club discussions my club has had. The story was so intriguing and thought-provoking; there were all kinds of issues to talk about. I highly recommend this book.of the most robust book club discussions my club has had.

But maybe I should not have bought the four book set.  I have to say (along with everyone else) that I loved the first three books. I couldn't put them down.  By Book 4 (A Feast for Crows) however, I began to feel like I'd fallen for a \\\\\"bait and switch\\\\\" scam.   Too many cliff hangers, too little character development. And my favorite character, Tyrion, is neglected. I finally started skipping some chapters entirely. How many times do I want to hear the same things again and again? I got tired of the endless back story that was inserted--all too regularly--into nearly every chapter. It's as though GRRM wanted to make each book accessible on its own to a new reader who hadn't read the previous books.  This makes book 4 no fun at all.  Not to mention all the subplots and side stories that distract from the major developments.  It's ok to ask the reader to suspend judgment from time to time, but enough is enough.     GRRM needs to put us all out of our misery and finish this series.  I'm not even going to bother with Book 5 and will wait and see if HBO does a better job of doing the project more quickly and succinctly--before all the actors get too old and die.      Read Books 1-3 and enjoy them, but don't expect the satisfaction to continue or the story to be done.     Maybe I'll read the final book when it comes out, but as a reader I feel that the author has broken his pact with the audience--to (as others have said) \\\\\"move the story along.\\\\\"    Too bad."	2011-08-10

Would the book forever destroy my love of Twilight?  I should confess right here and now that this is the first of her books I have actually read, being introduced to the saga through the films.   Already 2/3rds through Breaking Dawn and relieved to say that although I appreciate the previous reviewers grievances, - I am still fully caught up in the story and just as engrossed as I have been in the previous 3 films.  Perhaps being able to so clearly visualize my favorite characters has assisted with this?  .....as previously stated, not having read her previous books (although having read the Amazon reviews of Breaking Dawn, I am curious to see if they are any better) I can confidently state that Breaking Dawn is no literary feat....just a jolly good yarn.  There is no doubt Stephanie Meyer can tell a tale.  Very like reading the conscious stream of a tall-tale-telling teenager who is desperate to be transported in romantic love and and generally admired and adored by the whole world, and of-course... hormonally overstimulated ...nothing really ground breaking there.  So regardless, if like me, you were 'turned' by the films and just can't wait till the next two cinema installments to find out what happens to Bella Edward Jake and the gang, then go ahead. Just make sure you have the cinema versions bevy of beautiful faces in your head - it will help ease the gaps and smooth the bumps - no pun intended.   Oh- and naturally don't forget to suspend all disbelief (and be forgiving of the narrative - particularly the descriptive) as you go, after all isn't that the first commandment of a book of this genre?	2011-08-17

The only film nominated for this year's Best Picture Oscar that I would give 1 star, Extremely Loud stars former Kids Jeopardy! winner-turned-actor Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell, son of a 9/11 victim, who must learn to cope with life in the wake of his father's death. A year after the tragedy, when Oskar discovers a mysterious key among his father's belongings, he sets out to discover what it unlocks. Extremely Loud is a worthy story to tell, but director Stephen Daldry tells it in such a pretentious and shamelessly sentimental fashion as to make it distasteful.	2012-03-27

Bonnie Raitt has proven time and again over the past 4 decades that she is a consummate musician and rock and blues vocal interpreter.

The hype over this book is dumb!!!	"I love erotica books so when I found out this was one, I decided to read it. And the hype surrounding it had me wondering. I love being \\\\\"in the know.\\\\\"<br /><br />Anyway, this book is very boring and repetitive, like everyone says. The same phrases over and over. Characters are weird and somehow interwined in each others lives.  The sex scenes were cool at first but after while got long and boring and just had me saying \\\\\"ummmm.\\\\\"  And Anastacia climaxes so easy. I mean come on now; we all wish right?<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to any other erotica readers. I finished the book although I wanted to stop at the half point. Didn't want to feel like a loser so I finished; the only reason. I don't know who this author is but she definitely probably paid for the publicity; someway, somehow. Ain't hating but she got her money with a bad read.<br /><br />If you like erotica, read Zane books. She definitely deserves recognition and the scenes are amazing!"	2012-05-29

I didn't buy them for their intellectual content so I could get past the poor writing, but what I was surprised with is how boring, tame, and childish they were.  I was looking for something new, exciting, something, perhaps, that I had missed out on given my generation (hippy era, free love and all that)...sheez I'm telling you, women these days must be awfully frustrated, naive or infantile if this read turned them on.  I guess we still haven't gotten past the pat on the behind started at birth, this and a pair of handcuffs is all you're going to find in this book.

However, I read the 50 Shades of Grey series, and I liked that one far better than this one.  The love scenes were hot, but the story line didn't captivate me as much as he 50 Shades of Grey series did.  When I read 50 Shades of Grey, I wanted to read the sequels immediately.  I couldn't put them down.  However, with Bared To You, it's not driving me crazy to see the next sequel immediately.  But again, I will probably read it when it comes out just to see what happens with the storyline.	2012-07-23

Everyone else had read it but me, so I decided I should get it so I could participate in the discussion.  I thought it was a decent book, but I could tell it was the first book she had ever written.  From her descriptions of certain things in the book, it appears that she had definitely done some active research.  This isn't really my genre of book, but it was interesting.  I like reading books that I can't put down, this was not one of them.  I could stop at the end of any chapter & not necessarily be compelled to read the next chapter.  I'm currently debating on whether or not to finish the trilogy.  My friends say that books 2 & 3 give explanations, more character studies & are much better in general than the first book.  So maybe I will, but I'm not in a hurry.	2012-08-08

While outdoorsy, Cheryl lacked any previous experience backpacking and quickly found out that the trail would challenge her more than she ever thought possible.  She also finds out that the trail will bring rewards both mentally and physically that would far outweigh the hardships.<br /><br />I wish I could give ten stars to this book.  It is a brave memoir, as Cheryl holds nothing back, including shameful experiences with drugs, heartbreaking final moments with her mother, and feelings of inadequacy compared to the more prepared and experienced hikers she encounters.  It is truthful in that sometimes she feels like giving up, or wondering what the whole point of the experience is at her low moments.  She also experiences magical moments that she wouldn't have with a large group such as coming across a beautiful red fox on the trail or feeling simultaneously vulnerable and secure alone in her tent at night.  The glimpses she shares of her life pre Pacific Crest Trail are carefully chosen, and I feel like every story she shared had some meaning to the path of her life and the woman she became.  Highly recommended for women, outdoor enthusiasts, or anyone who needs some inspiration in their own life.	2012-12-14

It's different from the most disney movies and I like that about it. I did have a problem with the disc itself and I bought the movie through Amazon. For some reason the blu ray disc wont play a couple of seconds at the very beggining of the movie and my blu ray player automatically turns the movie off so I have to wait for the part to come up and fast forward it so that it doesnt do that.	2013-01-18

This time, the cell phones and computer cameras are focused on a teenage girl (Kathryn Newton) whose family allow a young boy in their neighborhood named Robbie (Brady Allen) to stay with them while his mom is sick. Soon after, eerie things start happening in the household, some of which focus on the girl's younger brother Wyatt. As the bumps in the night become more pronounced, the mysteries surrounding Robbie's family and the house across the street grow to the point where the only thing for the teen girl to do is investigate herself.<br /><br />I really enjoyed PA 1 and 2, 3 was okay and I was really disappointed with this one. It leaves more questions than answers and the ending happens so fast, you're wondering did that really happen?? As with the other movies, the beginning is slow and  the tension slowly, slowly builds. If there is a part 5, I hope it answers the questions brought by part 4. What was the connection with Wyatt? If Robbie was \\\\\"Hunter\\\\\"? Why were they after Wyatt? I think they are starting to run out of ideas and if that's case, maybe it's time to retire the PA series.<br /><br />Unless you are a diehard fan, wait for this one to come on cable, don't waste your money!!!"	2013-02-04

On the second disc he is tastefully accompanied by the west coast blues rock band Canned Heat. On so many of Hookers early studio recordings \\\\\"The Boogie Man\\\\\" was forced to work with studio musicians who didn't recognize the genius of his groove based, somewhat unpredictable, and idiosyncratic style. Often you would hear the band play chord changes that they thought should be there rather than following what John Lee was actually playing. This match up, with a popular white blues rock band of the time, may have begun as marketing ploy but turned out to be a match made in blues heaven. The talented young musicians in Canned Heat, accomplished bluesmen in their own right, obviously respected John Lee Hooker and recognized the value of his unique style. Likewise Hooker seems to genuinely enjoy playing with these young bluesmen, especially the late great harp man Alan \\\\\"Blind Owl\\\\\" Wilson. This album captures the essence of what happened when two generations of American blues musicians got together for a jam in 1970."	2013-02-28

Muse fans who want the same sound over and over will not be pleased with &#34;The 2nd Law.&#34;  But those of us who enjoy growth in a band have plenty to cheer about.  Electronic and Pop/Dance sounds fill a good percentage of the album, but some moodier gems can be found throughout.  The radio friendly &#34;Madness&#34; is incredible!  That alone is proof that the band is reaching out in many different directions.  It is not, as some Muse fans stipulate, a &#34;sellout&#34; for dollars.

I had high hopes for this movie and couldn't wait for it to come out.  If you've never read the Hobbit then there is a lot to like about the movie.  The cinematography is great with lots of action, although it had a bit of a Goonies feel to it.  That being said, if you are a real fan of the book, you will probably be disappointed.  The Hobbit is a great story and I didn't feel it needed embellishment or changes to the story. I felt like they decided to change the story and then as an after thought throw in some lines from the book. I'm actually sorry I purchased the movie and I won't be watching the next installments of the story.	2013-03-17

There were two different types of magic in this book: the content and the style. The content made \\\\\"magic\\\\\" an accessible reality. It seemed perfectly reasonable that there is a way the world works that only a few people can see and consequently manipulate. The magic of the writing is that it made everything exceedingly tangible. I've never read anything like it. There is a flavor in the words on the page; the abrupt introduction of the present tense at pivotal moments makes the events of the story abruptly and delightfully real. I regretted getting the book on Kindle: it felt like a novel that needed to be held in one's hands.<br /><br />The story is thought-provoking, the atmosphere is captivating, and the course of the novel develops into maturity along with its characters.

Compared to those two, this one just seems to be missing something. It wasn't quite as funny as those two either. It has an interesting premise, but I did not connect with the character Collin. He is obsessed with anagrams and trying to find a theorem that can predict how future relationships will end. I find both of those things to be very interesting, but there can only be a certain amount of ranting about theorems because I stop caring. The book definitely has some twists and turns that keep me interested. However, none of those points made me think \\\\\"Gee, this is my new favorite book\\\\\"."	2013-05-21

Graphics are amazing. It follows the storyline. You don't have to play all the time to do neat things.  We wish there were more mini games. There is one right now that is really cute. The movies are a great idea. I especially liked the behind the scenes one. What we all deeply appreciate is that acorns can be earned and won without money. It is so frustrating to play games where you can not get the really cool things unless you pay money. Please please keep up the great work. We will vote 5 stars every time!

Man did I feel old watching this train wreck of a film. A completely senseless barrage of quick cuts, boobs and stupidly. We've all been there before. Parents are out of town, time to call the crew and PARTY!! Right? I'm no exception to that one, but there is something seriously wrong with our society and the younger generation today. Completely amoral, without any self worth or character. The only thing these morons respect is money no matter how it is acquired. What's scarier is one of these A Holes will be running this country some day...hopefully I'll be long gone by then!<br /><br />I know, I know its only a movie, but it's a far too real reflection of our society for it to be funny to me, it's just sad and depressing. I give it two stars because I watched it all the way through and it was good enough for me to actually write about it.	2013-05-30

This album travels a bit away from what us fans are used to, but I honestly think that it is a good different rather than a bad different. The tracks Obvious Bicycle, Diane Young, Everlasting Arms and Worship you were the highlights for me, but in a album of good songs it's hard to say.<br /><br />There are albums that are good (a few good songs), albums that are great (A few bad songs) and albums that are amazing where every single song is great and no disappointments exist.

Well, Fanny were the first all-female rock & roll band signed to a major label (Warner/Reprise) back in the late 60s.  Hearing Haim's long-in-the-works debut album, \\\\\"Days Are Gone\\\\\", I was grinning from ear-to-ear!!  Vocally, the Haim sisters reminded me a LOT of the Millington sisters of Fanny...but without sounding retro in the least.  They have 80s and R&B influences galore, but not a pastiche.  If anything, and this is exciting, it's like the Haim sisters took synthetic 80s pop music and translated it to be played organically, as if they were in the 70s So-Cal Laurel Canyon scene.<br /><br />The tunes are catchy-as-hell but not formulaic...they sure know what they are doing.  I am not surprised the UK took to em first...they don't sound American really...they sound like Brits or Swedes IMITATING 70s So-Cal female American bands but with an 80s Euro approach...<br /><br />The songs are fresh, enticing, and exciting...now I want the 2CD import on Polydor/Universal UK with 2 B-sides, a live track and a slew of remixes!!<br /><br />Fave new band by far!!"	2013-10-01

Many people have decried about the ending, but that’s not even half of what makes this book a total and complete fail.<br />Early on, when they announced Allegiant would be written from both Tris and Tobias’s point of views (POVs) I was cautiously excited. I really looked forward to getting to know Tobias better (by seeing things through his mind’s filter). And then I read it…utterly disappointing.<br /><br />Did an editor even look at this manuscript before it went to press? Tris and Tobias think and process the SAME exact way. This is nothing short of poor and amateur writing abilities on display. Doing the two POV’s exposed Roth’s weaknesses as a writer—she could only write one character moderately well. All others were cardboard. No two people think and process the same on earth. A good writer makes it so that the POV ‘voices’ are so different that a reader can open a book to any page, remove name references, and STILL know who’s head we’re in.  Roth failed to do this and this is the ultimate failing of the book.<br /><br />Okay…and for her next book, can someone please help her brainstorm so every plot twist isn’t either solved or thicken by the introduction of a new serum. Seriously. It was like: Ahhh…the world is ending! I know. Oh let’s say there’s ANOTHER serum that gives people longer life and ANOTHER serum that heals wounds and ANOTHER serum that makes mean people smile and ANOTHER serum that tames unicorns and ANOTHER serum that…you get my point.<br /><br />Also, can someone please give the author some romance lessons? I mean…I guess romance in her eyes is “let’s fight and be mad and OH! let’s make out for a chapter, but now I’m mad again, but let’s find some place to make-out.” If that’s considered good romantic tension these days it’s no wonder the divorce rates are rising. But really, again, it just exposed shoddy writing. Roth can’t figure out how to create genuine romantic tension for her characters. Period.<br /><br />And the ending. Yes. We can’t ignore that (unfortunately, because I’d sure like to). Honestly, Roth’s characterization was so weak in this third book (because of the POV failure) that I didn’t even care by the time I got to the last couple chapters. That being said—I’m not entirely opposed to killing off characters (I’ve done so in my own books), but how Roth did it was wrong and ruined the entire series.<br /><br />Allegiant and subsequently its author, Veronica Roth (who, for the rest of this will be known as VRoth) failed readers on so many levels, but more than anything it/she failed a generation of teen readers who are looking for a new brand of hope.<br /><br />See, when an author writes a book they can’t just willy-nilly send it out into the world. They must keep in mind that their words have the power to shape and affect people. An author, especially someone with a huge readership, has a responsibility to their readers. They must offer hope within the pages of their book or it’s a pointless waste of time for the author and more so, the reader.<br /><br />Author William Faulkner said in his acceptance speech for his Nobel Prize, “The writer’s duty is to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.”<br /><br />Does there have to be an “and they lived happily ever after” ending? Absolutely not. Suzanne Collins’s (author of The Hunger Games series) editor put it best when she said that young adult books don’t need a happy ending, but in the end, there must be “a window left open”—a way where we can see that the characters we’ve grown to love can move on from tragedy.<br />There must be hope.<br /><br />Teens today are growing up in a far different world than the one I grew up in (and I’m not that old). I’m of the Harry Potter generation. The books of my youth were stories of teens that could rise up and save the world. My generation was the one told that if we go to college and work hard then we’ll get good jobs and we can accomplish anything. I’m the generation just in front of today’s teens—and the teens of today have watched as the bottom dropped out of my generation’s lives. Where going to college hasn’t landed many of my friends a job, instead it has left them drowning in debt. Where many parents are divorced and a significant amount of people I know have watched their family home seized by forecloser.<br /><br />Teens today have grown up watching this all unravel. For all of the aware part of their lives, our country has been at war. Think about that. They don’t know of an America not at war. Polls show that their vision of success is very different than my teen generation (which is only ten years ago). Today’s teen sees success not as owning a home, graduating college, having a family, or starting a business, instead the number one measure of success in recent polls showed them wanting to be debt free “at some point in life.” That’s it.<br /><br />Contemporary teens aren’t looking for books about teens saving the world. They only ask for the small hope of saving their small corner of it. So popular books for this generation are ones that in the end show that in the midst of a messed up world, you can find your own peace/hope, even if it’s just between you and one other person.<br /><br />Fiction has always been meant to combat the reality of life. VRoth failed us here. She didn’t show us what could be possible. Instead she smacked us in the face with what is. And we don’t need that. Because we’ve all dealt with more than enough loss and hardship and heartbreak. We don’t need books that repeat what we live every single day, we need books that show us that in the midst of a heartbreak world, we can find our own little pod of happiness/joy. That just because the world we live in is going to pot, doesn’t mean we have to lose hope.<br /><br />Whatever her purpose, VRoth showed teens with Allegiant one horrible thing: their life, their struggles, their fight for right…none of it matters in the end. Which leaves teens asking: what’s the point? If nothing I’m working for matters…why try? I know that’s not the message she meant to send, but when an author is careless with their responsibility to readers, this is the kind of thing that can happen.<br /><br />I’ll admit I spent a good amount of time reading Amazon reviews for Allegiant in order to see if I was the only one left disillusioned. I wasn’t. Sadly, I’m in the majority with the one star reviews.<br /><br />Most of the five star reviews I read were people who applauded VRoth on her bravery in “giving a realistic ending.” To this I say: there is a whole genre dedicated to realism. If you want stories that make you feel like someone has stabbed your heart on the last page with no chance for recovery, then feel free to read that genre. But for the ninety-five percent of people that read for enjoyment and escapism, sorry, we want some glimmer of a happy ending. If the Divergent series was meant to belong in the realism genre then it was marketed terribly because right now, all we have are broken promises to readers.<br />Also, even within realism, hope is usually the end game.<br /><br />Take the book The Fault in Our Stars which falls in the realism genre, the teens in the story who fall in love both have terminal cancer. In the end of the book Augustus dies. Why weren’t readers rioting over that? Because a promise wasn’t broken—when they picked up the book they knew they were going to read a story about dying teens so a teen dying at the end of the book was something they were braced for, if not expecting.<br /><br />Even still, The Fault in Our Stars ends with hope. Hazel realizes that although Augustus has died, her love for him doesn’t have to. Death doesn’t have to change the definition of relationships. My grandfather, who is deceased, is still my grandfather because I’m living and can claim him as such. The last line of the book is in present tense whereas the rest of the book was in past tense. Meaning life goes on. This is a hopeful message.<br /><br />VRoth killed her main character which is just hard to do well, especially in young adult fiction. Unless the author brings the character back after death (like Harry Potter), a theme/point is better demonstrated through killing a beloved secondary character like Augustus in The Fault in Our Stars or Piggy in Lord of the Flies (how’s that for old school). Otherwise, just save it for realism or adult fiction.

It turns out, if you take all that sex out, you could fit all 3 books in less then 50 pages. Christian is immature, acting like 17 year old boy, Ana's excuse for everything is - he is broken, &#34; Oh, my poor Fifty&#34; . It seems all they do is have sex, every couple of minutes, it's a miracle they can get anything done.  I think they should both see a psychiatrist for 2nd opinion, since I do not think Dr. F. is doing good job now. Also, one thing that I  could just  not get over and it was driving me crazy was - Ana and her inner &#34;goddess&#34; and her subconscious with her half moon glasses, just annoying. Ana has to ask for permission to do anything- go to work, visit friends, got out with friends, while it's ok for Christian to see/ talk to  Mrs. Johnson and his other subs. And I had to wait for book # 3 to hear what &#34; but plugs&#34; are, and it turns out it's not that exciting. In all honesty, I do understand why most people think this book is awesome- all that sex ( unhealthy relationship, but full of sex) can be interesting to some, but if you are looking for something that has a real story, just find another book.	2013-12-15

This book feels, like others have suggested, that you are reading little novellas, as you go through the big changes that happen in Theo Decker's life. The first part was the most interesting to me, when he and his mother experience tragedy in the museum and what happens to Theo afterwards.<br /><br />His time in Vegas was just an awful slog to read through. I felt dark and unhappy through it all as the author went into verbose descriptions of drug abuse and the highs and lows that followed, and Theo's time there was so lonely and neglectful.<br /><br />I get how the story all came together at the end, when there was a little bit more action as the characters strove to recover Theo's most valued possession, and I'm glad she wrapped it up nicely, but it was so long-winded. The author is an incredible writer with brilliant metaphors and descriptions, but I skimmed more through this book than I ever do. I usually hate to miss anything but I had to just to get through it, especially the very end.<br /><br />Also, there is a lot of vulgar language and swearing that I got tired of reading over and over again.	2013-12-24

Riddick always seems to be fighting against incredible odds to survive...and nothing like that was going on with this movie. He forms an attachment to a digital character, and although it was sort of interesting...it just never felt real enough for me to believe this human actor was bonding with the digital character. He ends up battling a small band of bounty hunters, and nothing he does was Riddick like...so, I felt a bit confused and disappointed at the end of the movie. Where was my Riddick?  :)	2014-01-19

Technically it brings the video and audio quality up to where it should be for home Blu-ray release.  In general, it allows one to fully appreciate the outstanding cinematography, sweeping vista scenes (reminiscent of some of Davd Lean's work) and sound work.<br /><br />The film was skewered by critics when originally released in 1980, at least some of which was a dog pile precipitated by the industry press coverage about the film's massive overruns in shooting schedule and budget. Even today, too many critics slam films that have production problems because of them and not the final result (The Lone Ranger is an example). United Artists didn't help by pulling it immediately after the NYC premier and having the 216 minute run-time hacked down to 149 minutes for wider release. That left the film with holes; it didn't tell enough of the story. The full 216 minute version isn't perfect, but it's much more cohesive. There are sections that could be a few seconds shorter to pick up the pace slightly. This is mostly near the beginning that sets an environment for the story, but not by much -- a few minutes total cut -- certainly nowhere near an hour. Perhaps among the biggest problems critics had with Heaven's Gate is that it's not a high concept film. They either wanted it to be one or were expecting it to be one, and when it wasn't they dished out their punishment.<br /><br />Approach the film without preconceptions from reviews you might have read or what a western genre film should or should not be. Keep your mind open and look beyond its genre into the narrative and its underlying themes. There is where I believe you'll find the power of the film and the story it tells about wealth, power, privilege and class warfare in the late 19th Century west.	2014-03-20

The style of this film is similar to the style long gone from the movie studios: a very engaging story, combined with great musical pieces, wonderful singing of Liza Minnelli and the joy of seeing DeNiro himself playing the saxophone pieces (he learned to play it, for this movie). The second DVD is filled with interviews, anecdotes, and little-known trivia about the making of this movie. In my opinion the Minnelli version of &#34;New York, New York&#34; is superior to the better known Sinatra version.	2014-04-12

However, technique is practice...training...and though I would never derogate it  (that would be perilously close to criticizing Bird for technique and that would be  borderline insane), it no longer thrills the same way rich composition does.  It is probably true that there are many years ahead of new compositions, but I am afraid that it is much more difficult to find interesting intervals and arresting harmonies.  Metheny, from around 1978 to 1993, filled the universe with compositions and arrangements that were as tuneful as they were technical.  He was not alone in that universe--Brazilians, at that time, were good company--Tom Jobim, Joao Bosco. Chico Buarque de Hollanda, Djavan, Toninho Horta, and Guinga were rich inspiration for Metheny, though he never copied them; rather, he created his own derivations and they were stellar.<br /><br />Though the Unity Band compositions are, occasionally, interesting, they are not warm and evocative in any way. This is not to suggest that Metheny has lost his passion or his penchant for musicality--rather, he is on a different road trip.  The terrain seems...well...dry and desolate.	2014-04-29

My. Goodness. “City of Heavenly Fire” was the most epic and awesome conclusion to the Mortal Instruments series that I could have ever hoped for! It was truly, truly amazing and I absolutely loved reading every single page. All of the characters were beyond exceptional and I loved them the most in this novel. Emma Carstairs and Julian Blackthorn were also extraordinary characters and a wonderful addition to the Shadowhunter clan. I can’t wait to read more about them in the Dark Artifices series!<br /><br />  I loved everything, absolutely everything, about COHF. I loved how there were an abundance of surprises and shocking turns of events throughout that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I loved how almost every character’s POV was incorporated, and that I was able to see what they were thinking and feeling at certain points of the story. I was completely enthralled from beginning to end and I experienced a whole spectrum of emotions while reading this book – some good, and others not so good. Everything was so detailed and intriguing, and there was certainly never a dull moment. It also blew my mind that Cassandra Clare managed to incorporate several TID references, and I thought it was freaking awesome that some of the characters from that series made appearances as well. There were many aspects of this story that made me extremely happy, and I truly couldn’t have asked for a better ending than the one that I received. It was just extraordinary, plain and simple.<br /><br />  Be prepared and plan to be surprised throughout this fascinating and intriguing conclusion to one of the most phenomenal series that I have ever read. Cassandra Clare is by far one of the best and most favored authors that I have ever read and she can write absolutely phenomenal conclusions. Fans of TMI will most certainly not be disappointed with “City of Heavenly Fire!”	2014-05-30

That logical part is important because the change element is less about trying to push players into micro-trans than it is making sure each game feels a little different.<br /><br />As a gamer, I can't see myself playing this for hours on end for weeks, but I do like to pull it out once in awhile and try a new tactic, just to see what it's like. And in case you haven't discovered this yet, it's a dark theme, the destruction of humanity and all, but the mayhem is a bit more calculated and numbers than some of he more mature themed games.	2014-06-01

None of us can deny responsibility for where we are in life. We have created our lives and lifestyles by the way we think. Nothing happnes by chance. There is no such thing as good luck or bad luck. There is a reason for everything. (The law of cause and effect) Our thinking is the cause and where we are in life is the effect. Think positively and you get positive results, think negativley and you get negative results. The good news is that regardless of the past, no matter how negative it has been, or how many times we have failed, we can change course at any time and redirect our lives, by changing what we put into our minds and by how we talk to ourselves.

What a moment and a memory captured in time of the greatest there ever was. The show he puts on is entertaining, moving (I cried even then as a child), awe-inspiring, and unforgettable.	2014-08-02

The cast is adequate enough to pull off a classic I think, but there is so much wrong with this film.  Vin Diesel is what he is, he plays one character always, so it is up to the director to use him like a hammer, &#34;you don't have to do nothing fancy, just hit the nail&#34; (director's fault there).  Now Vin is absolved so who's next, well the writer, the story seems thrown together hastily with an emphasis on the action sequences and not the plausibility of the scenes or continuity of the stories foundation (writer maybe).  My conclusion is someone with the power to edit this film to pieces, did just that (destroyed it).  I suppose I asked too much of this one, but it was in the shadow of &#34;the Chronicle of Riddick,&#34; and that was a fine effort with hopes of an even better squeal.  I would still watch all three films again, and most likely will.	2014-08-11

I have owned this album since it first came out, and have spent a lot of road trips or other miscellaneous time listening to music of all sorts. While on a recent fishing trip, I had this album set to repeat on my iPod. I listened to it for a whole day while hiking in the mountains fishing back country lakes. It dawned on me on the drive home(while still continuing to listen to it) that this is my favorite album of all time, and despite hearing the same songs over and over that day, it never got old.<br /><br />I have been a Rancid fan for a long time, and have enjoyed their work on almost every album they have made. Bottom line though, &#34;...And Out Come The Wolves&#34; is hands-down their best album, and my personal favorite album of all time, for any genre of music.	2014-08-21

Ian McEwan examines the choice to live or to die in his novel titled, The Children Act. Protagonist Fiona Maye is a judge in the family court in London, and her work life and home life are radically different. About to turn sixty, her childless thirty-five year marriage is strained because of her husband's infidelity. Tension at work accelerates when she is called into an emergency case of a seventeen-year-old boy who has refused a lifesaving blood transfusion for religious reasons. Her visit with the boy pairs two intelligent characters struggling with what it means to live and to die, and the choice to live or die, quickly or slowly. McEwan reveals all this in a compact novel that delighted me from beginning to end.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)	2014-09-26

None.I liked the tension between characters...but there's no climax. Simply an abrupt ending...with no resolution.<br /><br />The book was highly recommended by readers I trust. But, I understand now, where they were coming from. They were still in the middle of the book when they recommended it. They, too, anticipated an ending...of some-sort. They, too, fell for recommendation from people who just had not gotten to the point where the writing stops.<br /><br />I gave the book two stars for the writing. The description and compelling story-line is well done. There's only one problem, but I consider it to be a big problem (and I think most readers do), there's NO ending. The writer simply abruptly stops writing. I actually turned the next page anticipating the next chapter and audibly uttered, \\\\\"What the..No, this can't be all of it.\\\\\" But, it was all of it. No ending, no conclusion, no resolution. The writer simply stopped writing. What? Did the writer just get bored? Why put all of that time into a story, then simply leave off the ending.<br /><br />Would've been a five star book with at least an attempt at an ending."	2014-10-18

I purchased this backpack a little over a month ago for my Canon 7d and my 28-135mm lense. I read some reviews complaining about the materials. I think that for the price of $25 this is a very good bag. The only reason I returned it is because when I was about to go out of the country, I found myself having to take another bag for my computer and other items, so I decided to return it to buy the Lowepro Fastpack 250 Camera/Laptop backpack at $25 more in an Amazon flash sale. The Amazon backpack is light, has enough space for your camera and lenses and has straps for chest and waist. Like I said, I used it for a short time, so I cannot accurately talk about its durability, but the straps and the zippers seemed to work OK.	2014-10-29

In Maleficent, a vengeful fairy (Jolie)  is driven to curse an infant princess, only to discover that the child may be the one person who can restore peace to their troubled land.<br /><br />It is not often you can completely retell a classic fairy tale such as sleeping beauty and still have something that satisfies in both an old and new way.  Maleficent is done in such a way that is unique but still at the same time familiar.  Disney does a great job at retelling the story and giving us something more but still in a classic Disney way.<br /><br />The special effect are amazing and some of the best I have seen in a while but done in such a way, I almost feel I am watching an old classic Disney tale from many years ago.<br /><br />Jolie does a great job in her role and the evil fairy godmother and her costume and makeup are great as well, making her even more believable in the role.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable film that brings a new twist to an old tale. 4 stars.	2014-11-09

My favorite aspect about the band is that they have always experimented with different sound with each record. I enjoyed Blood, their foray into industrial hard rock, but didn't think it was quite as strong as their previous works after multiple listens. When the popularity of the band soared, and they announced that with Blood they had \\\\\"found their sound,\\\\\" I got apprehensive that they would stop experimenting, and just repeat the same album again.    Thankfully, Black Widow is mostly more ambitious and confident experimentation with the \\\\\"Blood sound.\\\\\" Sadly there are some experiments on this album that should have never escaped the laboratory.    The album opens with the abomination that is \\\\\"Sex Metal Barbie,\\\\\" the bands' failed attempt to make a \\\\\"silence the haters\\\\\" track. It is a redundant subject matter, since they already released the better song \\\\\"Whore\\\\\" on their previous album, not to mention Black Widow has two tracks, \\\\\"The Fighter\\\\\" and \\\\\"Natural Born Sinner,\\\\\" which deal with similar subjects. If you want to silence the haters, having a bunch of (presumably) thirty year olds make a rap rock influenced \\\\\"song\\\\\" that sounds like a tween wanksta wrote it is not the way to do it. The song is the worst thing this band has ever produced.    \\\\\"Big Bad Wolf\\\\\" does not fare better, all the vocal layering and instrumentals clash into a headache inducing cacophony during the chorus. I found Maria yelling \\\\\"Pig! Pig!\\\\\" (which sounds like \\\\\"Peh! Peh!\\\\\") about a hundred times too many to be very obnoxious. This is from a band where I enjoy the lead vocalist screeching like a banshee (example = \\\\\"The Gun Show\\\\\") it takes a lot for these guys to annoy me.    Mercifully, most of the tracks fare better:    Dirty Pretty - A Golden Age of Grotesque Marilyn Manson era sounding rock song mixed with a soaring ITM chorus. Very catchy and has been stuck in my head a lot since I first heard it. 5/5    Black Widow - I don't actually mind all the filtered robot vocals on this track because it sounds right at home with this dance floor ready Rob Zombie-ish bouncing industrial track. The ultimate earworm on this album. 5/5    Sexual Hallucination - I was expecting a groan-worthy song, but surprisingly this is really solid, it sounds like something off of \\\\\"The Dream,\\\\\" and the vocal performance by Brink and Brent Smith actually sells me on its silly subject matter. It's a surprise, since I usually find duets cheesy. 4/5    Sick Like Me - Hey look! The non-Maria Brinks get to build up a song! I love the guitar heavy intro (which this album could use more of) and the overall song. Sounds like a more confident \\\\\"Blood\\\\\" track. 5/5    Bloody Creature Poster Girl - This literally sounds like an old school musical mixed with crunching ITM rock. It's ballsy and one of the highlights of the album. 5/5    The Fighter - Oh. Yes. This is ITM ballad goodness. Shows off the powerhouse Brink's vocals can be. It's up there with \\\\\"The Dream\\\\\" and \\\\\"World in Flames\\\\\" as one of my favorite ballads from them. 10/5    Bones - A great song that switches from trippy 90's alternative rock to an epic chorus. One of the stronger, catchier songs. 5/5    Natural Born Sinner - Maria Brink's anthem for sticking up for her...sexuality? Or religious bigots who judge her? Not really sure, lyrics are kind of annoyingly vague. But the chorus is pretty fun to yell along to. 4/5    Into the Darkness - This interlude would have us believe that some negative voice of decent insults Maria Brink into crying for a minute and some change, then she is inspired to sing \\\\\"Out of Hell.\\\\\" I get that the band is attempting to do more theatrical stuff, but this is just flat out pretentious. 0/5    Out of Hell - This could have been a decent \\\\\"save the troubled youth\\\\\" ballad, but some of the lyrics are heavy handed and layered with more cheese by adding sound effects such as police sirens, yelling and the like to hammer in the tragedy. This would havebeen a great song if it was stripped down. 2/5    The running flaw of Black Widow for me is that there is way too much voice filters and vocal chopping throughout for my tastes. There was tolerable amounts of this on the \\\\\"Blood\\\\\" album but, but here it is oversaturated. I like Maria Brink's vocals like I like my sushi, raw. Sadly, her voice is chopped and filtered through a lot of the album, which prevents me from liking this music as much as I should.    A lot of older fans have been complaining that the current image of ITM musically is simply to hoist Maria Brink on a pedestal and promoting her sexiness. Lyrically there is nothing on this album to detract from those critics, as the album contains two main song subjects: Maria Brink is sexy/likes sex/is mind-blowing at sex (tracks 5, 6 and 8) and \\\\\"I'm Maria Brink, I'm awesome, and I will fight the haters\\\\\" anthems (tracks 2, 4, 9, and 11). I don't have a problem overall with their more theatrical image/music/live show, and can have fun with it, I just don't find it as personal and enjoyable as their previous work.    People on the Blood Legion bandwagon who started listening to In This Moment with Blood will probably have no issue with this album. Fans of the first three albums probably should proceed with caution. Despite all the criticisms I have with Black Widow, I enjoy most of the music experimentation on this album, though some of these songs should have been sent back to the drawing board."	2014-11-18

Excellent movie to watch with surround sound!  Most people are giving a review of the movie itself but this is a review of the 3d Blu Ray.  Great in 3d even though not filmed in 3d.  I love Top Gun so for me, 5 stars!  3 stars given because I find this copy of the movie so grainy.  People say that grain is added for the theater effect.  I don't ever remember a theater being this grainy.  I think it really detracts from the HD experience not having it clear and crisp when in 3d.  My Samsung TV will convert a normal movie to 3d and does a decent job of it.  For me, I think I'd rather watch the normal Top Gun 2d Blu Ray and let my TV convert it to 3d so it maintains the crisp clarity. This is only my second 3d movie, my other (Man of Steel)  is just as grainy.  reading more about these movies,  this is actually done on purpose.  Annoying I think!	2015-01-03

I never thought they could do those graphics on mobile, but they went through the time to do so. I spent my entire afternoon staring into my screen as Chompers (that what I call my goat) caused chaos through Goatville. In a nutshell, thank you so much for bringing Goat Sim to mobile!

Not only is his recovery from his rare illness extraordinary, but so was his NDE, since the part of his brain that experiences thought and emotion was dead. Some have criticized his book as being too &#34;new age-ish,&#34; but I think had he professed one religious belief his audience would have been smaller and he would have had to have gone with a religious publisher. Instead, Simon and Schuster picked the book up, and my version even had a reader's guide, and the book became a New York Times Bestseller. The author does identify as a Christian who worships in a church centering around Jesus, but his book's main message is essentially one that says there is a life after this one, there is a creator who loves and knows each one of us, and science does not have all the answers about consciousness. This book which relates an undeniable experience will comfort many and potentially change lives.	2015-02-25

It seeks to connect six very different story lines, each written in their own style. The stories take place in different times and are loosely connected.<br />I found half of the stories to be captivating page-turners while the others fell flat by comparison. The transition from one story to another is often jarring (intentionally at one point but seemingly unintentional at others) which made it difficult to really get wrapped up into the narrative. It felt as if just as I was starting to get into the new characters and plot it would suddenly stop and switch to the next one. Sometimes the new story felt boring in comparison to the previous one which I enjoyed much more, but this would be a personal gripe since I know some people will prefer different story arcs than I did based on their tastes. This is the crux of the problem with Cloud Atlas. By including such a variety of plots and writing style it can be difficult to enjoy every part of the book unless you happen to enjoy the particular parts included (I for one did not enjoy the murder mystery segment)<br /><br />I would recommend giving this book a chance if you are interested in reading a novel with unique structure and style, although I personally thought it could have been done much more smoothly.	2015-02-27

James writing tends to have, but at least in this third book of her trilogy, she's improved &#34;some&#34; as a writer.  Redundant style includes the overuse of so many phrases. She has her characters Christian Grey and Ana Steele employ a thesaurus to outsmart one another yet James didn't reach for one in her own writing.  That's unfortunate. She did improve on making this third book more action packed with a clear antagonist from the get-go and more drama. Of all her books, this one is the page turner.  But of course, the sex is well overdone but that's what perhaps makes the book popular.	2015-03-06

Perfection in performing and leaving you ready for more twisted, nightmarish images. The special features are awesome and the transfer of this film is mastery at it finest. Never has this film been such clarity. They honored this film. KINO tends to always create mastery. Highly recommend for the quality given to this transfer and to the reality.

The nine month versions are much more stretchy and easy to get legs and feet in and out, but now that we are outgrowing that size we ordered these. We ordered the whale version, fire truck, race cars , monster, &red with a little raccoon on a scooter.  The whales & Fire truck are the best out of all of those - a bit more space for chubby baby thighs.  The fabric seems a bit softer too. Still not as soft as our 9month ones but better than others.   Update - they have gotten much better with use.  Feet and leg sections seem to have stretched a bit and fabric is softer after a few washes.  We ordered the dump truck version too.	2015-01-31

I almost never 'gush' about a product, but these capris deserve a little more enthusiasm.  I absolute love everything about them.  The Product Description says it all!  First of all, I normally wear an XL in just about everything, but the Large size in these capris fit perfectly (nothing bad about that!).  Secondly, the pants I received (Watermelon) are made from high quality fabric with some 'weight' to it, and the workmanship is A+.  Maybe most importantly (for me) is these pants really are 'High Rise' (yea!!).  I feel totally comfortable going out to a yoga class with no worries about accidentally showing butt-cracks or belly flops.  They actually make me look slimmer because they hold everything in the right place - no more muffin tops!  From now on, these are my ‘go to’ yoga pants.  I’ll buy a couple more pair for variety.  By the way, the product description mentions that the colors of the 'Watermelon' and 'Pop Orange' are more vibrant than what you see in the photos.  With respect to the Watermelon, WOW, they are not kidding.  I can’t imagine Pink getting any ‘hotter’.  Love it!  Thanks to ’90 Degree’ for actually delivering the pants as advertised.	2015-08-29

She would then need another one or two sweaters under the garment to keep warm.  This robe is warm yet lightweight so she can just wear this alone over her nightgowns or pajamas or even during the day over casual wear if necessary and it remains very comfortable and attractive.<br /><br />It is a beautifully designed robe.  It is very light grey, (silver), with a lovely silvery white brocade design.  I ordered her a medium as she wears a size 8 and it is slightly large, but allows her to add an extra sweater when necessary.  I find it so important as you age to continue to keep up appearance and feel good about the way you look.  This way if we have family over and she does not want to get all &#34;fancied up&#34; she still looks appropriately attired with a fresh nightgown and this exquisite cover-up.  I could not be more pleased with the fit and the overall appearance and neither could she.<br /><br />ADDITION: I forgot to mention the two medium sized, satiny pockets that sit at hip's length on either side.	2015-03-14

It is really fuzzy, cute, and well made. I got the cheese cat color in a small size, and it fit me perfectly (I'm about 4'11 or so). The tail hangs a little below my rear, but it looks like a tail nonetheless. The stripes all appear to be sewn on, however, one of the stripes is coming a bit lose. Either way, I suspect it will last. We have never machine washed this thing at home yet, though it will probably survive many washes to come. The product arrived MUCH earlier than expected. The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because when we received the package, the product came with a weird smell. But it was nothing that a little surface washing couldn't fix. I'm not sure if the product was made with a funny smell or of it just rode here in a stinky ups truck, but either way, it needed to be washed before it was worn. Also another thing you should be somewhat careful of is the tail. Sometimes if you sit on the tail it would feel kind of weird underneath you. However, it isn't that bad.<br />So, overall, this is a good product for a cheap price, and I would recommend it.	2014-10-22

I ordered her the XL (age 6-7 years). She is a size 6 in clothing, average size. The suit is snug on her, I was hoping it would be just a little more roomy. The suit does have adjustable shoulder straps, but you can't let them out too much or the suit is too low in the front. If you have a girl who is a size six in length but on the skinny side, the XL would work well but if your girl is any bigger than average, I would recommend the next size up. I will likely be ordering the next size up because she is IN LOVE with this suit and I don't think it will fit her very long.	2015-01-08

I was a little skepitcal at first because the price was so affordable.	I had recently bought 1 pair of Carhart socks for $12.  They were not worth it to me, they were simply extra thick white socks...  I figured I'd try these out given the description and price.  I wear work boots all day.  My feet sweat a good bit.  These Socks Rock.  I immediately bought 3 more packs ( 6 pair) and will be ordering nothing but these from now on.  I can hike in these, wear these all day in or outdoors and They are what I've been looking for and the price is just right.  Thank You for making a great product.  I will dig through all of my white work socks to grab these before any of those others...	2014-10-07

I usually sew/assemble my own costumes because I think store bought costume kits are overpriced for the quality, but this Halloween I just didn't have the time, so I bought this based on other reviews and I have to say I am very impressed, especially for the price (about $35). I've bought costumes before for twice the price that look nothing like the picture on the package, are poorly sewn to the point of being unwearable, and are made of materials that are uncomfortable and seem like they'll fall apart the first time you wear it. Not the case with this costume. It is almost exactly as pictured, with the exception that the tights are a transparent beige, as other commenters have noted. All of the seams are sewn very well and the materials are comfortable and of decent quality. I had to tug the boot covers pretty hard to get them over my boots (size 8), but I was never concerned that they were going to tear and they fit perfectly. The garments are designed to fit the proportions of a normal human being, unlike other ones I've purchased that look like they were made with a vaguely humanoid alien in mind. I'm a size 8 dress, 5'6&#34;, and weigh 139 lbs. and ordered a medium, which fits very well. The dress hugs all of my curves in a very flattering way, with the exception that the top of the back is slightly loose, probably due to the fact that my chest is slightly small in proportion to the rest of my body. Other commenters mentioned that the dress is very short, but for my proportions, it's not any shorter than pictured. The main complaint seems to be the mask, and I can see why. It fits over my eyes correctly, but it's made of a pretty stiff rubber that digs into my eyelids. However, I found that if I just wear the mask over my glasses it fixes this problem and looks fine. If you're lucky enough to have perfect vision, I would recommend buying a cheap pair of sunglasses or reading glasses at the drugstore, popping out the lenses, and wearing the mask over them. I think the costume works great as is, but if I had the time I might have glued on some extra fake ivy to jazz it up a little. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase, and am looking forward to being a hot redheaded villainess on Halloween :)	2014-10-27

I love the look of this top in the picture but  was disappointed with the actual design. It comes beautifully packaged, the berry color is lovely and fabric is a very nice medium weight. Not in the least bit flimsy or thin. However, the top is actually a very short crop length that doesn't cover my belly which then requires the wearer to perfectly wrap the ties to ensure no flesh is exposed. It's not that difficult but didn't leave me feeling comfortably covered during the day when you are moving around constantly or shifting the top slightly to use the restroom etc. As the top moves it's easy for the long lengths of fabric to adjust and ruin the look of the top. I wish the length was longer and then the ties wrapped over the top. I feel like it's going to be too much work to wear as often as I'd like and just leaves me feeling like my belly/back could be exposed too easily.	2014-12-31

The first was 6 years ago.  I finally bought a second pair when the zipper gave out. I have other scrub pants. Most have been little better than pajama pants.  The other pair that I had for awhile was a pair of Cherokee pants.  My problem with those was that they were not true to size, and the pockets started to fray and I had to stitch them back on. This happened to each side twice. When I blew out the crotch trying to help move a patient that was the last thing I was willing to tolerate. In 6 years the only problem I had with the dickies scrubs was the button falling off in the wash. But since it has belt loops (so awesome) that's not a problem. If you are in the healthcare field and you actually use your pockets, dickies are worth the price. They last. They'll fade a bit but they are worth the price.	2015-07-28

The fit is odd for me, although it's definitely because it's a men's jacket and doesn't accommodate the curves of the average woman. The top portion fits super large on me while the bottom portion is a little snug in the hips area. So if you're a man, then I would estimate that this coat probably runs a size larger than normal, which is good for layering if you intend on wearing a sweatshirt or sweater underneath.	2014-12-04

I was worried about how it would fit since I usually run between a small and a medium, but I ordered the size 4/5. Thankfully it fit perfectly and is not too long with the wedges that I bought with it. The high low gives it the best of both worlds, the formality of the long dress but with the ease of not trying to hard with the low front. Absolutely love it in the pale pink color.

But purchased a size 30. For one particular reason...i have a butt. When I put the 30s on they fit really good. But when I look at my physique from the back or side there is so much space needed to be filled. So I really needed to buy a size 28...but can't because I have a large athletic butt.  So I had to buy a size 32 in red because the cool blue and green were sold out. ..crazy I'm a size 28 wearing a 32. They fit the same around my thighs and nicely around my butt.  They look good, and feel good as well. They are very light weight, thin material, but a good quality. If they restock the blue/green color I Will buy them in a size 32.	2014-03-10

My unhappiness with it however is my blazer arrived in a plastic bag and when I took it out of the bag, I noticed how badly my new jacket REEKED. I don't know how or why, but it was packaged and sent to me smelling musky and gross like bad body odor. This blazer is labeled hand wash only, so of course, I went ahead and hand washed it (nothing but red dye gushing out of my brand new black blazer, which left it already looking slightly faded) and hung it to dry and wore it the next day thinking it was fine. Nope! Had to take it off when I got to work when I realized it still STANK BADLY. Now I'm going to have to pay good money to have my brand new, already faded blazer dry cleaned because the seller mailed it to me stinking of body odor and moth balls.<br /><br />Thanks for that, seller. 1 star for you.	2015-05-09

It looked very nice and the material seemed to be quite sturdy. It arrived within about about 5 days after my purchase, which was pretty awesome. However what I dislike about it is that it's a little bit too wide and it doesn't have too much space to hold my stuff, I could only fit about 2 small binders, 1 notebook, my wallet and my glasses on the inside. This is a problem because I have so many books to carry around while I'm at school. Also, the straps are way too long for my liking, the backpack doesn't really fit well onto my back due to this and it gets very awkward and uncomfortable. I think this bag would be much better suited for a taller person, I'm only 5'3. I really do like the design, but I'm probably going to have to return it due the the issue of the straps and the limited amount of space.<br />~<br />12/16/12 So I've had this bag for a couple of days and due to the shipping charges I wasn't able to return it. However I did fix the straps by sewing them a little bit tighter so they fit better and I also made the flap at the front of the bag a little bit tighter. I'm really satisfied with it, if only it had arrived that way.	2012-12-14

I was hoping to add to my son's collection when I came across these on Amazon.  All of his other ties were handmade from various vendors on etsy.com and cost a substantial amount more so when these arrived I was disappointed in how thin and delicate they were in comparison to the others.  With these you pretty much get what you pay for.  These wolud be a great addition to a child's dress-up play collection but if you want something that will hold up well over time this is not it.	2013-12-27

But it just looked plain, so I went to the dollar store and bought packages of stickers to put on the smooth buckle. Now the belt is the &#34;sticker belt.&#34; The good news is the magnetic buckle--easily manipulated when a little one has waited until the last minute to run to the bathroom.	2015-04-29

I had bought this dress for an upcoming event because I believed the reviews about the quality and fit. It just arrived today, and I am so very, very sorely disappointed with everything about it, I am at the verge of tears.<br /><br />The material is very cheap looking in person. It is so poor quality, and makes the dress look like something one picks up at a flea market as a bathing suit coverup. The midrift \\\\\"ruching\\\\\" is poorly done, and instead looks like a ratty oversized t-shirt gathered at the sides and hangs loose around the middle. No amount of ironing this thing will ever make it look right.<br /><br />I expected better quality construction at least for the pricetag of over $120. This is supposed to be an evening dress, but I wouldn't even wear it to a family BBQ, and now I am stuck without a dress for my event.<br /><br />NEVER AGAIN."	2013-02-04

If you are an active and large breasted woman, I'd highly recommend this bra.<br />I do adult gymnastics and this bra provides me enough support for tumbling on the floor and vaulting: I am a 28H for reference.<br />The band is nice and wide along the rib cage, the wire doesn't extend underneath my arms, and the arm straps are wide and padded.<br />However, my favorite thing about this bra is that it is breathable. You can't tell from the pictures but there is the main frame of the bra, then the mesh covering. They left a small gap between the mesh and the frame at the middle of the bra. This is a feature the larger breasted of us usually don't get.<br /><br />TIP: Don't put this in the drier. I've had mine for two years and the band losing its elasticity (as to reasonably be expected) is the over give I've seen with it.	2015-06-27

It's definitely eye-cathing, and my sister-in-law, who i bought it for, loved it.  However two possible negativies are, one- it might be a little clunkie to fit on small one hand held purses, and two- it took a while to fix on to a purse.  The outer perimeter is magnatized and can be 'snapped off' and left hanging, which has no purpose other than to change the disign a little bit.  However, after being attached to a purse, it still looks good and is always a conversation starter with friends or anyone who notices.	2013-07-19

I'm 6'1\\\\\" and have a 33\\\\\" waist and I bought the large, which fits perfectly.  Surprisingly perfectly, actually; most size lists tell men with my waist size to buy medium, and both mediums and larges are often too short.  These have enough elastic that they fit comfortably at my waist with several inches of stretch left and yet aren't too big...and are still plenty long enough with room to shrink.<br /><br />These pants are very lightweight, so I'll probably need to trade them in for a heavier flannel or fleece or something when winter truly hits, but they're perfect pajamas spring and fall.  And they have pockets!  [Drives me crazy when sleep pants don't have pockets.]<br /><br />Good quality, good price, good description (other reviewer: that last is directed at you)...good choice."	2011-10-01

I purchased this mask for Halloween, and the pictures don't really do it justice.  In person, the glitter is a lot more blended and doesn't look like it was applied with a roller glue like in the picture.  The feathers are nicely put together and it's pretty durable... as it did last me all of Halloween, with a few drops in between.  It is also tied with two ribbons on each side.  The ribbons are attached really securely so they won't snap/break, it does untie pretty easily since it's ribbon however, unless you double knot it.<br /><br />The only qualms I have about the mask are that the bottom feathers kind of run into my nose/mouth area.  This can be cute, however, it can also look as though you have a moustache.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very cute mask for any occassion that requires it!	2011-02-22

I mean, certainly two thousand reviews can't all be telling the truth?<br /><br />Here is my unbiased review, continue reading at your own perril. The only reason I can write this review, is because I'm wearing the Mountain Three Wolf Moon tee shirt, I couldn't read or write until donning this majestic garment, I've read Jack Londons \\\\\"White Fang\\\\\" cover to cover in fifteen minutes flat with complete conprehention, and I just learned to read yesterday!<br /><br />The moment I dressed in this mysterious attire, I knew I had stumbled upon a glorious freak of power. It happens instantly, I immediately kicked off my shoes and trotted out the back door. Time seemed to stop, kinda like the matrix, and my senses were one with the land. Smells and sounds were acutely more distinct, I could see and move with ease, almost wolflike, and I remember thinking, could this be? My persona had transformed from ultimate dweeb to Brad Pitt in Legends Of The Fall. The most interesting man in the world from the Dos Equis beer commercials has this shirt, I'm sure of it.<br /><br />The beast within was taking over, and I remember how awesome it felt to feel so free for the very first time. It was the most fantastic moment and it was interrupted suddenly when my girlfriend yelled at me for relieving myself on her flowers. I quickly unlifted my leg and whimpered back to the house. She met me at the door, and I was expecting an ear pulling and told \\\\\"bad dog!\\\\\" at the very least. What happened next confirmed the questions overwhelming my carniferous brain. I could tell my girl friend was livid and was about to chew me out big time, but the moment her eyes locked onto my Mountain Three Wolf Moon tee shirt, her intended rage vanished and turned into a lust craved she wolf. I won't elaborate what happend next, but she sang Who Let The Dogs Out five hours straight after that, crazy as f*** I know!<br /><br />I happend to walk by a mirror and had to stop, my tongue was friggin ginormous, it would make Gene Simmons from Kiss feel inadaquete I kid you not! Trust me though, the women in your life will be your best friend for life, even if they hated you before. Just don't wear it around your ex-gf or wives, unless you want them stalking you like a sexed crazed creeper on meth and if they get too close to you, plan on a trip to the ER to have them surgicly removed. I made the mistake of wearing mine to church and an hour later my yard was filled with nuns smoking cigars trying to shove cash down my pants with money they stole from the collection plate.<br /><br />One last bonus that you can expect while wearing your Mountain Three Wolf Moon tee shirt is, bullies and would be thugs will be rendered powerless in your presence. I decided to test this at the local bar, A**Kick, notorious for harboring inbred gorrilla type people. They wear affliction and tapout shirts stained in syrup and rancid beer. At midnight, when the moon was full, I walked through the door, and that's when all hell broke loose. Any normal Joe would have been mauled and raped walking into this place by themselves, but I had my wolf pack with me. The moment my foot crossed the threshold of the bar, the music stopped and the cool night wind blew from behind me, sending shivers to all those inside. Goons and felons scrambled for the nearest exit, trampling each other, as if oxegen had escaped them and were fighting for their last breath. The unfortunate few who made eye contact with The Pack, it did not end well for them. They instantly fell into a cowering heap, submissively urinating themselves and whining like little b*tches, snot bubbles drippin down their noses. The female Dj tipped her hat and played Wild Thing and Bad Moon Rising consecutively for the rest of the night and I drank for free.<br /><br />There are some who will not understand this bewildering garment of power, which I believe is made of actual wolf hair, and some will follow their instinct and forever be changed into their wolf pack, to those of you I solute you and will join you in song when the moon turns full.<br />I have spoken and it is so."	2013-02-11

It's not a auto ranging meter and don't know if anyone else has experienced this but the diode test doesn't work.<br /><br />I wouldn't compare this to a high end meter but it's the only cheap meter under 20 dollars that even has a CAT ratting.

I put one in between the passenger seat and console of my F150.  It works fine when I'm by myself and I want to stick my wallet in the holder but if I have a passenger it is uncomfortable for them.  Also, the cup holders should have been designed better so a can or smaller cup (diameter) can stand up firmly and not wobble.<br /><br />Bought one also for durango and immediately removed it as its even more uncomfortable for the passenger.  Both vehicles have center consoles so maybe it will work better if your car does not have one.<br /><br />I thought it was a good idea but wouldn't completely recommend it.	2015-07-14

If it is turned on the noise from itself will sometimes bump it up to full volume, which isn't that loud. When it is switched on it is very quiet and it takes a long time to become loud enough to hear, which by the time you're done backing up it still won't be audible. Even when it adjusts itself, 5db above other noises is not noticeable and quite unsafe. This was going on a cummins plow truck with straight piped exhaust so it needed to be loud. 107db is not loud enough for a diesel. Returned and am instead going with a simple ECCO 850 with 112db for the same price.	2015-02-13

US	18090030	RS2FDRG0C4YCE	B000HZBRSC	70772078	Security Chain Company SZ115 Super Z6 Cable Chain for Passenger Cars, Pickups, and SUVs - Set of 2	Automotive	1	6	7	N	Y	SZ451 Too Tight for 275/60-20 Tires	The SZ451 was supposed to fit my 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 2WD with 275/60-20 Goodyear Wrangler SR-A tires. I had managed to get them on once before after fighting with the fit for close to an hour. The second time I attempted to use them it took 45 minutes to put on one side during a snow storm in the Sierras on Christmas Eve. The fit is so tight that it took both me and my 17 year-old son, using all our strength, to make the final connection. I just put new Goodyear All-Terrain Adventure tires in the same size on last week. Today I tried a dry-fit test in my driveway. There is NO WAY the SZ451 is going to fit that tire, even though the SCC fitment guide says it will.<br /><br />I bought a set of &#34;Titan Chain Alloy Snow Tire Chains - Diamond Pattern - Square Link&#34; chains today after watching a Youtube video showing the ease of their installation. I'll update this after I get them and have performed a dry-fit test.<br /><br />UPDATE - 2-16-2015: This afternoon I performed a dry-fit test of the &#34;Titan Chain Alloy Snow Tire Chains - Diamond Pattern - Square Link Model TC2533&#34; tire chains. What a difference it was to install these compared to the SZ451. The instructions were super simple and I installed the first side, without jacking up the vehicle, in approximately 6 minutes with no hassles or troubles at all. I HIGHLY recommend the Titan chain if you have 275/60-20 tires.<br /><br />If you need more proof watch this You Tube video, or just do a Web search for the chain:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNjFLIKtoec<br /><br />UPDATE: 12-19-2015: SCC has changed their fitment guide and no longer lists the 275/60-20 tire as applicable for the SZ451. Unfortunately it is too late to return the chains for a refund.	2015-01-25

Automotive	5	9	9	N	Y	Very pleased with the units	Very pleased with the units. &#34;Warm white&#34; is pushing it a bit but the color is a pleasant bright white with no blue overtones. The light output seems a bit better than the twin 1003 bulb units I replaced. I'd put the output somewhere between a 1003 and an 1156. The lighting is a touch uneven but much better than other units I've seen. The lens is a diamond design to the sides spreading the light with a small clear patch at the bottom projecting a little more light towards the floors, table or whatever, a nice touch. Everything fit correctly and uses modern surface mount technology on the LED boards.<br /><br />I'm satisfied enough I'm going to replace all the old fixtures in my RV with these units. The small current draw versus incandescent alone is worth it for boondocking.	2015-01-10

I ordered these for my 2007 Silverado and am dissapointed in their fit. They are made of a good material, but they don't fit my floorboards very well. Triple checked application before ordering. The drivers side mat slides forwards and backwards several inches, and will not stay in one place. The little screw in carpet holders are a joke. They will not screw in to help hold the mat in place. The passenger side liner fits better, but not a great fit as described. I even checked the numbers again to make sure it is the mats that Weathertech calls for, and it is the correct number. These mats have no spikes on the bottom to hold them in place like other companies. Super fast delivery by Amazon. They were supposed to be a week and a half delivery time and I got them in 3 days! If I was to make this purchase again, I would go with another brand.5 stars for Amazon, 3 stars for the mats.	2014-10-22

It makes entering/exiting so much easier and really adds to the appearance of both vehicles.  I opted to go the wider 6\\\\\" oval bars as it does make a difference in wet weather.    Westin makes excellent products and I would recommend them to anyone.  One item: Those who have written bad reviews based upon the fact they did not know they had to purchase mounting hardware separately really do need to READ the product description. I have been guilty of this too. You must order hardware based upon your vehicle make/model, not one size fits all. If you find such an item, I recommend you pass it up."	2014-08-21

The 2nd gen Toyota Tacoma PreRunners and 4x4s don't come with a rear sway bar setup from the factory for rear articulation; but if you hardly go off road, adding a rear sway bar could make a big difference. I drive a 2010 Tacoma PreRunner and decided to purchase the Hellwig 7671.<br /><br />Pros: Easy installation, Reduced body roll, positive steering feedback, cleared my aftermarket exhaust<br /><br />Cons: Installation instruction pictures could be more detailed<br /><br />Bottom line: If you hardly go off road and enjoy driving on mountain roads and taking quick turns, then I'd highly recommend investing in a rear sway bar.	2014-08-19

The regular shipping also arrived faster than estimated. This was the second of the same switch I bought for the car in the past few months. The first switch was bought on eBay and was less expensive. When I tried to install it, it did not fit in the position, had no directions on how to install it, plus some of the switches were spotty and did not work all of the time. I returned it with a letter and follow up email to the company and eBay but did not get a reply nor a refund. Hence, why I tried Amazon and the Switch Doctor who had instructions plus a lifetime money back policy.	2014-08-04

I thought I'd try the Cabin Bright LED's to conserve battery power-we dry camp on BLM land most every winter.  LED's are by far the most energy-efficient lighting using just a fraction of the power required of other types of lighting.  LED lighting should also  last MUCH longer than any other light.<br /><br />Installation was easy-just dry run it before peeling sticky-pads.  There's even a video on YouTube showing typical install.<br /><br />I had a technical question about light output (which is warm white as opposed to the cool white from the tubes), so I emailed Cabin Bright directly.<br /><br />Within two hours I had a personal phone call from Joe, the owner, which resolved the issue.<br /><br />These lights are awesome!  I'm quite happy with the lights, and very impressed with the excellent customer service from Cabin Bright.  I will be purchasing more of these LED's to complete the conversion of my rig.<br /><br />I whole-heartedly recommend Cabin Bright to all my RV'ing friends!	2014-02-05

Other than that, this is a pretty good harness.	2014-01-27

Air leaks are nil which makes the helmet quiet and perfect when riding in cold weather.  I like the helmet so much I bought two.  Comfortable, very light weight and the chin bar locks with gentle pressure when closing the lid.  My old HJC helmet Symax III the lid had to be slammed on both helmets I owned.  This RPHA Max helmet is the way to go.  One problem, the top front air vent has a flimsy reed valve set up that can rattle in the wind. Both my helmets do it on two different motorcycles.  To stop this adjust your windshield or place some electrical tape over the vent or slip foam inside to control air inlet turbulence.  This rattling noise is a minor problem and easily managed, so I still give the helmet five stars.  And, you can bring the helmet to any authorized dealer for warranty repair, you do not have to return it to where you originally bought it according to HJC Warranty Instruction on their Website  JamesRussellPublishing.biz.	2014-01-13

I figured for the price it would be worth trying. I do not regret my purchase. It took all of two minutes to install, then I turned the radio on and pulled into the garage. As I entered there was a slight hesitation for about 4 seconds entering the doorway, then it picked back up and I have not had a problem since then. I use regular radio for two favorite local stations and usually keep it on satellite radio for other favorites. I live in an outlying area and receive with no issues. I've made trips to Charleston SC, Columbia SC, Atlanta GA and Savannah GA besides my local driving and no issues. The good part is the antenna doesn't hit the garage door anymore and is not an eye sore any longer. looks good on my 2013 Ford F150.	2014-01-09

Throughout the winter they kept my hands warm on my cold steering wheel  for 2 days between charges (about 2-3 hours at max temp).  I also used them on a ski trip with outer protective gloves,  In 20 degree windy weather, I turned them on at the bottom of the slopes and off while I skied down and they lasted all day (about 8 hours) without any cold fingers.<br /><br />On the last cold day, I apparently dropped them on the floor of my car, batteries attached and left them there all summer.  Come this winter, I found them and charged them back up.  They worked great.  Battery charge was just as long.  But about 2 weeks after the warranty expired the right glove heating element stopped heating.  I wrote to the service department.  They asked me to send the gloves in with the receipt (which I promptly printed from Amazon).  2 days later I had a brand new set of gloves.<br /><br />I highly recommend these gloves.  Prior to using these, I always got chapped hands that cracked and bled in the winter despite use of various creams, etc.  For some reason, keeping my hands warm makes all the difference in the world.  I'd buy these again,	2014-01-07

The description stated a &#34;soft fleece inner liner&#34; but the cover I received had a liner material which appeared to be no different a material than the outer cover except it was white.  I talked to Amazon who referred me to the manufacturer Coverking.  I call Coverking and talk to their customer service which denies they state &#34;soft fleece inner liner&#34; in the description for the Mosom cover.  I tell her to take a look at their website.  She says she doesn't have access to the internet.  I tell her to take a look at their catalog which they enclosed with the shipment.  She denies it says that in their catalog either when it is right there in the major feature description.  I ask to speak to her supervisor and she tells me they are all out.  I ask that her supervisor give me a call back and I never heard from anyone.  I did return the cover and got a prompt refund from Amazon.

I did the coils at the same time as renewing the spark plugs, mainly because of the labor savings.  The ACCEL coils fit as good as the OEM ones.  Between the new spark plugs and the coils, the engine does feel smoother at idle, and seems to be more responsive at acceleration.  ACCEL uses high quality materials that should stay within spec longer, and has experience in developing high performance products.  And, more importantly, ACCEL has quality controls to match the electrical characteristics requirements with precision and consistency -- which is the key to a good coil.  Since any gain in horsepower is the same as a gain in mileage, and with the high price of gasoline, then it makes sense to invest in this small upgrade.  It is also good to look at those yellow coil packs on the engine.	2013-08-16

US	12720412	R2DHBM6SR2H4W	B000BYEMFO	620327009	Bosch 04278 Ignition Rotor	Automotive	5	6	6	N	Y	Does what it is supposed to do	Works perfectly on a 1997 Honda Prelude. Replaced the rotor as the same time as the distributor cap and wires and plugs. Might as well since you are in there and it is so cheap.<br /><br />The trick to getting it off is that the one screw that holds it in, is only accessible when the engine cylinders are in a specific location. I found it easiest to disconnect all the spark plugs so it wouldn't actually start then crank the car momentarily. After you crank go and check if the screw is there. If not, crank again, check again. Took me about 8 tries, but it is really random. The precise way of doing it is to turn it by hand or to put in gear and roll it slowly, but I found it much easier to just crank and try.	2013-07-03

I thought that's what I was getting--the whole kit, for a price a little better than even Harbor Freight's press-puller kit could be had. So, i bit.  and then back it went, with my suggestion to Amazon that they update the picture of the product as you see they have done now.<br /><br /> I ended up using a 20% coupon at Harbor Freight during a sale, and I got their press-puller kit for about $40.  And, I have to say, the Harbor Freight press-puller kit worked just fine on both my vehicles, a 98 Ford F150, and a 03 VW van.  I used the HF kit to do both upper and lower ball joints.  If you are in need of purchasing a press-puller kit, I'd suggest taking a look at the one from HF.  You can save at least $50.	2013-05-03

When I bought my car It only came with 1 key so I ordered this to have a 2nd. If you only have 1 key to start with you will have to have this professionally programmed by a dealer. I hated this key when I first got it, the buttons are set down in, instead of being raised like the original key, so they are hard for me to push. But when I took it to the shop to be programmed, I also bought an original for $150. The dealership could not program their manufacturer key for some unknown reason, but this key that I got from amazon programmed within a few minutes. I ended up leaving there with just the 2 keys, saved a bunch of money and was extremely glad I bought this generic one.<br /><br />Differences from original manufacturer key:<br />-Doesn't say Ford on it<br />-Buttons are recessed, not raised<br />-Can be hard to push<br /><br />Pros!!

The head swivels which makes it so much easier than many of the other tire gauges.  The digital read-out is very easy to read for even for the over 40 folks who can't see small letters. You don't even have to turn it on - if you put the gauge on, it turns on as soon as it senses air pressure.    My ONLY reason for giving it four starts instead of five is that it only reads in .5 PSI.  It's digital, so I would think it wouldn't have been that much more difficult to read in .1 PSI.  But maybe that keeps the cost down, which is a good trade-off for me if that's the case because I wouldn't pay more for the extra level of granularity.  I haven't had it that long so I can't attest to the battery life.  The case is also nice to protect it if you keep it in your glove box.  Overall it's well made and solid.	2011-10-05

I twice tried to tow the Ranger on a trailer going 55 MPH down the highway. The first time one corner came loose and started flapping, I thought it was just me not installing properly. The next time it tore one of the straps loose, pulled the velcro from the roll bar and shredded the rear of the top (I didn't catch it quite as soon as the previous time). It does only take a couple of minutes to put the top on and take it off so I guess that would be the best practice, but I don't want to mess with it every time so I guess I will have to go with a hard top.	2011-08-22

After searching, I chose this one. It fits my needs beautifully. The kids stay warm during freezing weather while I can stay at a comfortable temp up front. A soft, cozy blanket that feels so nice on chilled fingers. It heats up in minutes(3) and covers two car seats that are next to each other. The 'on' switch is a choice of 30 or 45 min heat time. Which may be good.. could never forget to turn it off on a long trip. Non machine washable, but not concerned. I would recommend this blanket if you live in frigid weather. Don't need to crank the heat to unbearable levels just to get a bit of heat back to the kids.	2011-01-03

This gas unit is quite nice.  It arrived guickly, was a breeze to get connected, and looks really nice in the area.  It puts out a lot of heat which is adjustable with the valve on the inlet.  Only disadvantage is that it doesn't have a built in pilot light or sparker for ignition, but a long grill lighter works just fine.  We have now had a local gas company install large cyliners by the side of the house and run a line under the deck so the installation looks much cleaner and avoids having to worry about refilling the 20lb grill tanks.    Overall a really nice unit, at a reasonable price.	2010-01-08
US	12044014	R2SGFYRXTBHD32	B0000SX1YE	33505017	IceDozer Plus Ergonomic Ice Scraper	Automotive	3	2	13	N	N	Hard on your back, handle can leave blisters	The blade itself works well, but the handle isn't designed well for traditional ice scraping.  I created a new start-up company during a recent snow storm, we remove excess snow and ice from roofs, driveways, and sidewalks.<br /><br />Knowing shovels would not be adequate, I purchased 15 IceDozers in hope for more efficient workmen.  I came to realize my men were coming to work with sore backs, blistered hands and shattered egos.  My start up is now losing money because of this faulty product, it should really only be recommended for small houses.<br /><br />If you still wish to try your luck with this product, there is a modification that can increase your productivity.  I found that taping/gluing a broom handle to the IceDozer will allow you more leverage while while scraping.  None the less, be sure to know an accurate square footage estimate of the property you will be working on.  I would not use this on a house larger than 3,000 square feet, or 4,500 if you are using the broom handle modification.	2009-01-28

I seriously LOVE this! My husband works 2 hours away and drives every day. I have severe OCD and can not stand a mess.

I was given an opportunity to purchase this at a steep discount to test it out and share my opinion of the product, I now need to go back and purchase a second one at full price for my own truck! It is perfect to attach to the back of the passenger seat with the easy to use, yet strong clips! The inside is perfect for keeping items or even to put a trash bag in and actually use it AS a car trash bag. There is a nice pouch at the bottom that perfectly fits a box of kleenex. (Huge plus for moms on the go! My son is always asking for a tissue and now he can reach over and grab one and not distract me from driving!) Their is also a nice side pocket that can hold a roll of trash bags or even work as a drink bottle holder for someone in the back seat. The drawstring top is perfect to keep everything put.

It doesn’t matter how many that you have they are never an exact science. However, you learn a few tricks along the way to help yourself cope with several situations. That is where the Baltic Amber necklace comes in.<br /><br />A fussy child is hard to deal with at times. This is true if it is because of colic, overly crying, or teething babies. This amber necklace is one that help with everything, or it seems so. One of my babies drooled all the time. Drooling became very annoying after a short period of time, but nothing compared to the teething cries. Your baby will receive wonderful benefits from this necklace. The pain reduction from teething, it has anti-flammatory benefits.<br /><br />This is a necklace that should be on every baby’s neck. It is a beautiful dark rich amber color. Each of the beads are separate from the other ones. That way if one amber pieces falls off, then they all will not fall off. This was a great feature because even if my child was rough on it, I didn’t fear all the pieces falling off if something happens. This is a necklace that every baby should be wearing. It will not only make the baby happy, but it will also make all mommies happy too.	2015-07-07

I had low expectations for this product, and was thus pleasantly surprised.  I like that it folds up relatively small. Dirty sides fold together.  My daughter is around 30 pounds, and I have no issues with bending or lack of support. It seems sturdy.  The little handles on the front are great. We've used it in a number of public restrooms and its helpful. When just starting out potty training, she wasn't quite sure how to balance on larger seats and this helps.  Its also helpful if she's out with my husband and has to use a men's public restroom.  It keeps her little hands off especially dirty toilets.  My main issue is that because of how it sits on larger seats, she is positioned very near the front of the toilet.  Often times when urinating, the urine misses the toilet all together.  However, we have the same issue balancing on a large toilet without this seat, too.  Its just because little legs are only so small and the child just can't sit further back.  Overall, I'm happy with the quality. We don't use it all the time, but for $9 its very helpful to have.  Its especially nice if your child is just learning to use the toilet.	2015-03-03

I am using it to monitor the area outside of my front door so I can see who is there.  It does an excellent job of this and based on the testing I did, I'd say it would make an excellent baby monitor as well.    The product comes sturdily packaged with instructions that I feel are comprehensive and clearly written. There are two power packs, one for the camera and one for the monitor, each having a different sized plug so you can't mix them up.  After charging the monitor, I placed the camera in the corner of the kitchen where it wasn't easily seen.  I waited for my wife to go in there. I could clearly see her, and at that time I started talking to her from another room, using the monitor's built-in microphone, with the sound coming out of the camera's speaker.    She was startled and was looking around wondering where I was, haha.    The built in microphone on the camera also lets you hear what is going on in the room. The audio quality isn't hi-fi but it is acceptable and serves the purpose.  I'm happy with the resolution on the monitor.  Again, it isn't the sharpest but you can definitely see what is going on in the room with enough detail, and in color.  The infrared night vision also works very well - it shows me black and white images of the objects in a darkened room.    The pan and tilt controls work well, too. I can adjust the camera quite a bit to the left, right, up and down, certainly enough for the purposes of monitoring a baby and also of seeing who is out on the porch. I like having that flexibility.    The monitor has a couple of thermometer functions, one for reading liquid or surface temperatures, and one for reading body temperatures by pointing it at the forehead from about a 1/2\\\\\" to an inch away. I found that both of them are quite accurate. The surface reading matched the thermometer in the room, and a reading of my own temperature showed 98 degrees.    All in all, this is a very useful product. Like I said, I am not using it for the intended purpose since I don't have a baby, but the concept is the same for monitoring what is going on outside our front door or for monitoring the activity in a room. The product seems of good quality, it is easy to set up and works like it is supposed to."	2014-09-18

We have lots of swaddles, a couple dream blankets, and lots of bibs, and were REALLY looking forward to the musy mates. Unfortunately, this one is just terrible. They are REALLY cute-- at least my son thinks so. When he saw this he squealed and played with it excitedly for about 5 minutes (which is about the extent of his attention span right now). However, by that point one of the seams around the nose had already frayed (at least the top layer-- there are a couple layers of fabric, so no stuffing was showing). The bear itself is REALLY stiff-- almost like it is intended more for display than for actual use, though I know this is not the case. I know the company has gone through extensive testing to try to improve this product, but unfortunately the material they are using just isn't suited for this purpose.<br /><br />For the sake of full disclosure, I will say that I did not pay for this product. Last year I purchased a Kangaroo musy mate at a local boutique for my son, but when I went on the A+A site to find care instructions I didn't see the item. I did some googling, found out that people were having lots of issues with the musy mates falling apart, and e-mailed A+A asking if they had any safety recalls out on the product. They said they didn't, so I let my son have it, and it's held up fairly well for several months.<br /><br />Last week, someone from A+A contacted me, citing my previous inquiry about the musy mates and acknowledging that there were durability issues with the original product, but offering to send me a free item of my choice since they claimed to have made substantial improvements. (As I said, my original item turned out to be fine, so they did this not because it was unsafe but because they wanted to prove that their new product was improved.) My son loves this bear, but unfortunately I have to say that our experience with this bear was far worse than our original kangaroo musy, which is still going strong.<br /><br />I really hope they either fix this issue or pull this product, as I'm sure it's costing them a ridiculous amount of money and they really are an excellent company.really hope they either fix this issue or pull this product, as I'm sure it's costing them a ridiculous amount of money and they really are an excellent company.	2014-03-02

When I received it I looked it over and found some things I knew I could fix.  The first thing I did was remove the white ring from the top of the toy.  It has an opening where a child can easily get their fingers or nose caught in it and it would pinch.  I trimmed the piece of cloth, the tab, that was linked to the ring, right down to the head and it's fine.  I then examined the wings and discovered 4 strips of stiff plastic with sharp edges that can poke through the material on the wings and would seriously hurt a child's gums.  I clipped the stitching close to the body of the toy and made 4 slits in the fabric of the wings just large enough to remove the plastic strips.  I then restitched the wings tightly to the body so that the slits won't show and the wings hold.  I then stitched around the flap that goes over the mirror because the mirror isn't soft and wouldn't be comfortable if the child bit down on it.  There's still a bit of it shining through, enough to peak the interest of the child.  The outside coating of the mirror is soft and can easily be peeled off and I wouldn't want a child sucking on it or chewing it, especially a child who's teething.  The eyes are cloth which is great and the red teething medallion tucked into the pocket is large enough so as not to pose a choking hazard to a child and is soft enough to make their gums feel better while they're teething.  The hard ball in the head that houses the rattlers is protected enough to be safe for a child.  The squeaker in the lower left hand wing is soft enough so if a child bites down on it it will be comfortable and where it squeaks they'll probably do it often.  I left the rings at the base of the firefly intact since, although they're not as soft as the teething ring, they can't pose a problem to a child.  Now that I've made these adjustments to this toy I feel comfortable giving it to my little nephew.  The colors are phenomenal, the expression on the firefly is delightful and I really love this toy and my nephew, which is why I made these adjustments.  It was worth the effort.  I have also decided to add a piece of colorful cloth over the piece of metal that serves as a mirror.	2013-11-09

Pros- it can cover a large area and awkward shaped windows and does well blocking the sun Cons- the suction cups come off sometimes and I have to restock often. I tried this in the winter and the temps definitely affected me putting it on and I had trouble using until the spring. Also I use on the back drivers side window. I can't put in one corner because the window has the manufacturers writing and this will not stick to it. Also it may say it can go on a large area but I don't think this would cover a back window, only sides as I have seen it advertised.<br /><br />Honestly, I got the Britax stick ones as well that just clings to the window and it works well without fuss.	2013-08-17

It is well built, quiet, comfortable and easy to put together!  The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was because the back is a little low.  I'm 5'8&#34; and when I'm sitting in the chair the back comes to about the top of my shoulder, just a little too low for me to comfortably rest my head back while feeding or rocking my little one.  I did find that a small throw pillow tucked in behind my head remedies this nicely though and makes me completely comfy!  I don't think you'll be disappointed if you buy this chair.  :)	2013-04-01

Both girls are fascinated by the toys and they have learned to appreciate them in different ways as they have gotten older. This exersaucer is sturdy and easy to clean. It has grown with my girls from the shortest setting at 5 months to the tallest setting at 10 months. I would highly recommend it.

"I picked one of these up for my second child, wondering if I would *really* need it, since I fed, diapered, and napped my first completely on-demand for the first six months. However, I knew that with two little munchkins, that exhausting game was not going to work, and hoped this timer would help us to establish a better routine. As it turns out, baby #2 was a high-needs newborn, complete with a fun little colostomy. When I say that the Itzbeen baby timer saved my life, I'm not sure this is an exaggeration. Those first few months home with him (and a two year old) were the hardest of my entire life and this timer helped me to understand his rhythms so that I could work with them to establish a routine that worked for all of us. I used the \\\\\"90 Minute Miracle\\\\\" principles to help him sleep and the timer really helped me to keep track of his waking and sleeping. My only complaint is that I wish it had a memory so I could go back and see the last, say, 5 or 6 time intervals for each button. However, I guess that's what a good old fashioned pen and paper are for.<br />Oh, and my other complaint... Child #2 became completely fascinated with this little gadget. One day shortly after his first birthday, he got a hold of it, and while my daughter was bathing, he decided to see what would happen if he chucked it in the bathtub. Our beloved Itzbeen did not survive this unfortunate event. Now that our third child is on the way, I plan to purchase another of these and hope it does not suffer the same fate as its late cousin."	2013-01-12

I like that you can adjust the suction with your breath so that you are not sucking too hard and damaging baby's membranes.

Of course, my family and friends are totally grossed out by the idea of sucking snot, but the mommy in me says no big deal.  It's actually simple and ingenius, and I wouldn't use anything else.

It's nice that you can choose between side-to-side or head-to-toe rocking motion just in case your child has a preference. Not only is it functional, it's beautiful for either gender and matches nicely with furniture.  The only problem that I had with it was the top music button became dislodged when I pressed on it with little force...so beware...luckily, my husband was able to repair this.  Other than that, I love this beautiful swing and highly recommend it!!!!<br /><br />PROs:<br />-beautiful<br />-two options of swinging motion (side-to-side or head-to-toe)<br />-music is nice<br />-seat is portable<br />-attached blanket is nice<br />-easy to assemble<br />-entire swing is easy to move from room to room<br /><br />CONs:<br />-music buttons easily dislodge with minimal force	2012-05-07

I finally came to this one. It's a little bulky, a little heavy, and has some quirks when you lean it back. But overall this is a quality seat, and works very well. My boys enjoy the pattern, and seem to be comfy. Also, their heads don't usually fall forward when they fall asleep in this seat, partly because it leans back slightly.	2011-11-10

We use this product sparingly, but it is very handy in that it allows you to get your hands back and get some work done around that house while keeping your child safe and secure to you.    Our child enjoys being in the harness.  However, he will get hot if we are outside in the summer.  If this is something you are going to use frequently, I would advise purchasing one of the higher-end, breathable models.	2011-10-25

While Dr. Brown's bottles do require more cleaning I like the bottles.  My son didn't have problems with colic so I don't know whether it's due to the bottles or not.  I don't know about the labeling coming off in the dishwasher since I usually wash my bottles by hand.  I do like the slenderness of the 4 oz. especially.  They are easy for my son to hold.  The 8oz. is thicker and a little more of a handful for my son but he manages.	2011-08-02

This has been a solid product and would recommend for other parents. I have not tried other types of baby-baths, but have no complaints at all about this one. The cup (fish) that comes with the tub is a great tool; the baby loves getting the water sprinkled on his head like a shower. The reclining position and shape of the tub seems natural and comfortable for him. I like that the inner lining of the tub is cushioned with foam-like material (and not hard plastic). Draining the water out of the tub is easy. All-around, it is just a very good choice.	2011-06-23

Our son loved it and it worked great, twice.  Turns out this watch has a high susceptibility to water.  If you are teaching your children to wash their hands after they use the potty, then you will likely have a low lifespan on this product.  It was great two times, but the product design needs to be modified a bit.	2011-06-08

The vinyl part is great, wipes clean easy. The problem is the trim around the bib. It is not vinyl, but cotton. Any food that gets on the trim can't be wiped away as easily as it can be on the vinyl part. I end up having to put these in the washer constantly.    If you want something you can wipe off and reuse several times, I would recommend the Bumkins. Those are fabulous.    These are adorable if you are looking for cuteness over functionality though.	2011-05-16

I got this item for my little girl's first birthday. She is now 16 months and she still can't do the top sorting part. The shapes of the letters make it so it is really hard to do it. You have to get the letter in just the right position to make it go in. She can't do it and ends up getting very frustrated and angry each time she plays with this toy. She likes that she can stuff things inside it, but even that is hard. The door to the barn does not open easily. She can't do it on her own, and brings it to my about every 2 minutes for me to open it again.	2011-02-10

The material is good but like others have said it's very comparable to a dog toy...and it's even been mistaken for one!!  The legs are too long in my opinion and DS has gagged on them when he sticks Sophie in his mouth too far.  I really dislike the smell of the rubber but I guess that comes with a rubber toy.  Overall I'm glad MIL gave us this as a gift but no way would I have spent almost $20 on it.  Just sayin.	2011-02-03

I was initially against any double stroller; I just didn't want to mess with it. But when our daughter was 2.5 years and our son was four months we were taking a month long trip abroad, and I knew we wouldn't be able to corral both kids without one. The Cortina Together worked wonderfully for what we needed. We already had a Chicco car seat and Trevi, so we knew we liked Chicco. And I wanted both kids to be able to sit comfortably. I knew a sit and stand would be lighter, but didn't want my two-year-old to have to stand or sit on an uncomfortable, tiny seat all the time. After hauling this thing all over Europe, here is why I love this stroller:    You can easily snap the Chicco car seat into it. I love that you can place it in the front seat or back seat. When we want more control of our toddler, we place her in the back and baby in the front. But when we are just enjoying a walk she loves sitting in the front to see better, and hop in and out on her own. It is also a great feature that the rear seat fully reclines. This is nice for a napping toddler, and makes a great bassinet for a sleeping baby.    The basket underneath is very large and very accessible. Adding the zippered front is a huge help, to be able to access things even when the back seat is fully reclined. I was able to easily carry diaper bags, luggage, groceries, etc in that thing. I also like that the basket stretches in front of the rear seat. If our daughter dropped anything, it caught it, which is nice when you are running to catch a train, and not keeping track of everything!    The canopies work well. They aren't large, but the fact that they adjust so easily means you can keep your children covered from rain, or keep the sun out of their eyes, no matter what angle. I also love having the two cup holders for mom and dad, as well as the two cup holders on the front seat. A con, however, is that there are no cupholders for the back seat. And the two cup holders on the front can be switched which is nice. But, if you have them turned out, you can't fold the canopy up when the stroller is folded, and if you have them turned in, you can't fold the front seat down to accommodate the car seat. But this is super easy to adjust. The seats move very easily as well - one hand adjustment. The brakes and wheel locks are great and easy too.    Even with its large size, the stroller turns on a dime. The handle bar adjusts easily for pushers of different heights. Sometimes we found the stroller can be a little tricky to fold up - the lock only requires one hand, but you have to maneuver the stroller just right to get it to collapse on itself. When folded up, though, it's not too huge - it easily fits in our Honda CVR, no problem. It's great for on the go, easy to set up - no adjustments needed.    The stroller proved to be very durable - considering we hauled it on and off planes and trains, as well as up and down cobblestone streets and off-road. Like others have said, it is heavy, but it is a double stroller, that's what you get. It is lighter than many options, though. My close friend has a Graco double, and she is super jealous of our Chicco! One other negative is there's no handle or really great place to grab the stroller to carry it when it's folded up. The feature that allows it to still roll when folded is nice, but obviously doesn't help when you are going up stairs.    I truly love this stroller, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Coming from one mommy who didn't especially want a double, is only five feet tall (and not very strong!), but realized she needed it, I would never use another double stroller. This is the way to go!	2010-10-19

My particular model came with the Soft Fit shields, and I thought I would try the classic style that is all hard plastic to see if there was any difference in my milk production.    I was never able to tell a difference, even positive or negative, as to the efficiency of the shields in the extraction of milk.  These were a bit less comfortable than the Soft Fit, but were not painful or unpleasant by any means.  I would encourage any working mother to order a few extra sets of shields to make pumping at work easier.	2010-09-21

I bought it because it seemed like such a good price and it was the same color and brand as my changing table.  Well first off we had a hard time putting it together because a couple of the assembly holes were drilled wrong and didn't match up.  Luckily my husband is a handy guy and just drilled new holes to make it work.  My biggest complaint is it squeaks! I have to oil it at least once a week.  Of course it always starts squeaking when I am nursing and rocking my baby to sleep.  I wish I would have spent more money for a better quality chair.	2010-09-11

Downside was that it started tearing slightly after 4 flights.

My mouth is notorious among the local dental hygenists for being small and having tight spaces.  For years I did not floss at all because I simply could not get the floss my family used in between my teeth.  It was a physical impossibility.  Of course, like so many in my situation, I eventually learned about Glide floss and was happy for that.  So for me, trying any other brand was a real gamble.  But I am so glad I did.  Ecodent leaves my mouth feeling fresh, whereas mint Glide just left my mouth feeling uncomfortably numb and chemically.  It is better for the environment.  And more than that, it has proven to be much better for my teeth.  It is more substantial than Glide but still gets into the tight spaces.  It does a better job in those tight spaces because of being more substantial.  I was always careful to wiggle my Glide around to work the space as much as it could, but I never received as rave a review on my oral care from my hygenist as I did after using EcoDent.  I also like the EcoDent replaceable head toothbrushes.  I know toothbrushes don't waste that much landfill space relative to a lot of our stuff, but it is always nice when you can support a good cause.	2015-07-27

She got counseling, and stopped cutting, but the scars remained, and some were deep. This NewGel+ gel sheeting for scar management worked wonders on her scars. They have been greatly diminished, only a few of the deepest scars still show, but only faintly. So yes I highly recommend the NewGel+ sheets for healing scars. We did not need the special tape that we bought with it, the gel sheets are self-adhesive and they stayed on. This product was just about a miracle for my loved one.	2015-06-25

The moisturizer makes this really easy to use, you barely even need any shaving cream. The trimmer is great because it has 4 different levels - you can even take the white part off for a really close shave. Just watch out because I keep accidentally hitting the On button for the trimmer while I'm using the razor end - the button is right in the middle where your fingers go when holding it. I tried this free thanks to Schick.	2015-04-22

It's not the Oilatum we knew and loved.  Thus far, I know that contains perfum suitable for a cheap whore.  It wreaks.  The new manufacturers are too stupid to realize that people with particular needs and possibly problems bought the old Oilatum.  It was never inexpensive.  Do they not wonder why someone would pay such money for a bar of soap?  The last thing Oilatum fans probably wanted was a change in the formula and a perfume added.  I can't bear the scent of it, so I may never use it.	2015-04-21

I wasn't specifically shopping for perfume but was looking for a gift for my mother's birthday and thought, &#34;Hmm, maybe I should try a new scent.&#34;  When I told my sister, her response was, &#34;Why?  Are you trying to smell like a porn star?&#34;  My answer is this - &#34;If this is what porn stars smell like, sign me up!&#34;  I love this scent.  Not too over the top, sophisticated and understated.  The bottle is a substantial weight, too, with cute heavy metal hearts.  I love to wear this and people do stop me to ask what I have on.  The price was right, the smell is lovely, and I am completely happy.	2015-04-15

One would think, so your mouth is dry, sip some water. I drink water all day long and the dryness would bounce right back. I tried Biotene products, including mouth spray for dry mouth. It works okay, and tastes like crap. Thayer's Peppermint Spray tastes like peppermint. It isn't overly sweet. Just a nice clean minty taste. It does a nice job with dry mouth symptoms. I will buy this product again.	2015-02-07

There were no odors and it was so so soft. After having it in now for almost 2 weeks I am disapointed. In the back it gets matted up and tangles its so annoying because then I have to wear my hair up cause if I wear it down it will get matted. The hair didn't shed at first and I didn't seal because I wanted to test it out but it has begin to shed a lot. The hair was so beautiful in the first week but now it's not so good. I probably won't buy from this company again.	2015-01-29

Despite its price, the wig was a very nice quality (maybe a little on the thin side, but that's all right--my hair naturally puffs out and thicker wigs make it seem like the hair is almost floating off my head) and it looks very nice. I cut it so that it would be more of a match for what I was going for, but it still managed to turn out nicely, since some of the curls/curly texture kept even when it was less than half its original length. The only critique I had was that the bangs seemed a little long, but that seems to be a problem with almost every wig for me, so that might just be a personal issue.<br />All in all, it stayed nice, even after a long day out (as pictured), and I would almost definitely buy this in different colours.	2015-01-22

I'm impressed. I was also worried I may have to let my goatee grow out a bit before I could effectively grab it to remove it, but I initially used this about twice a week, and now once every week and a half works. The hair seems to grown in softer and lighter as well. It's normally very prickly and coarse. I did get a bit overzealous the first time I used it and had it directly on my throat area for a little too long and it burned me a bit, but it was a quick lesson in how to properly use it. I'm a dark skinned woman in her 30's and have had facial hair growth for as long as I can remember. Daily shaving was just a bummer along with the razor bumps that came with it, nearly a year or laser hair removal treatments were completely ineffective, and this has been the only thing to leave my face completely smooth. So happy with this!!	2014-12-27

I used the magenta BTZ Colour Hair Mousse on my 2 inch roots of Natural Sandy Blonde hair, and Semi-lightened strawberry blonde/faded copper hair dye. I left it on for only 20-30 min and my hair is a complete mess. I would be less bothered if it washed out right away but - Nope! I've used 3 types of shampoo, a dish soap, and now my only hope is a lightening developer. The colour on the first night was nice, but with each shampoo the quality has become cheap looking, and my hair has never felt chalkier. I did a test strand that turned out fine, and I don't know if it was because I used it the first day and the best foam comes out first but the all over head was not a great choice. This would be great for peek-a-boo colour strips but the fading is so nasty I might just recommend getting it done by a professional. I've been colouring hair for a while, but I've had greater results from BTZ Colour Jamz in terms of pigmentation and overall quality. Don't bother with this temporary, it sticks around so long you'd be better off using permanent dye - it would look a whole lot better.	2014-12-18

We were prescribed 5% cream by our pediatrician, yet there was a lingering fear the cream wasn't good enough. Which is why I made this purchase, for reassurance.<br />Does it work?<br />The validity is debatable because we used multiple methods at once. However, I can say, the soap feels like any neutral soap bar would, produces a strong odor, just like the instructions suggest and the company shipped it to us in the suggested time frame.<br />Overall, I'd like to believe the 2-pack of soap bars aided in ridding us of scabies in under a week.	2014-10-18

I bought the sheer sunlight shade in a convenience drug store that long ago, and fell in love with it.  After awhile I saw it was discontinued and I was disappointed.  I really love this gloss.  Now I found this shade and several others on ebay.  I'm not sure if they are being manufactured again since they are available here on amazon.com but hopefully they have come back to stay.<br /><br />Quite a few people think that the product gets wasted because it's too thick and you have to put a lot on to get color.  They also say that it's way too sticky.  Well let me tell you something.  If you put this product on with a brush it comes out even and beautiful and you do NOT have to glop it on.  Second, I love the fact that it is really sticky because my lips feel nourished when I slather it on and the shine is second to NONE.  I really mean it.  Put on any other gloss that is being manufactured today and you will never get the shine that you get from this stuff.  When they named it Lip Shine they really meant it.  When I found these colors again, I tossed all my other glosses and now only have these.  Tip: They look great with a complimentary lipliner shade.  Awesome!!<br /><br />A little pot goes a long long way!	2014-10-15

I purchased this product after my mother had given great reviews on it! She swore that it was the best foundation/bb cream she had ever used, because it made her skin look flawless. However, I didn't find that it did the same for me. I found the product to be too watery, even after I had shaken the container like crazy. I felt for my skin type (oily skin), it didn't cover well enough. My mother on the other hand, has normal to dry skin and it really does wonders with her skin type.

I looked at many reviews and different types of wigs and I ended up picking this one.I bought this wig to complete a costume and I would not consider it for every day use because it is a very bright red. I was a little sad by the color, but the lighting in the picture could be the cause for the color difference. It is more of a bright red like the little mermaid from Disney. It does get frizzy, which I expected. My solution is just a little light hair spray before going out to make it not so bad. This wig is very long which looked amazing and it fit perfectly (I do not have a very big head tho).	2014-08-09

I was skeptical of this product working but after reading all the reviews, I figured all those people can't be wrong. And I was right - this product is simply amazing & removes the dead skin from my face that my usual facial scrub does (and more) but without the harsh ingredients! My skin feels so soft & smooth after I use it but here's a word of advice when using this product - do sections at a time so you don't waste the gel. It's more of a watery consistency so I usually start with my forehead, then my cheeks/nose then my chin because it kinda dries after a minute. I use it twice a week and this is my 3rd week running...kinda expensive too but well worth the money!	2014-07-09

When I received the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor for review, I had been using the Venus Embrace by Gillette for at least 4 years. For a week or two, I used both in tandem for underarm shaving to see if I could distinguish the difference, using the Embrace on the left and the Hydro Silk on the right.<br /><br />The Hydro Silk was brand new and the razor head on my Venus Embrace already had wear on it. As a result, I expected the Schick razor to outperform the Gillette razor. Au contraire! It was a pretty even race. I kept having stubble on the right, so after the first week or two, I swapped and used the Embrace on the right and the Hydro Silk on the left. I'm very glad I did this, because I would have given the Hydro Silk a lower rating if I hadn't. What I found was that apparently the angle at which I shave my right is different than the way I shave my left. So, while I can get a perfectly smooth armpit on the left, I find it challenging on the right to completely remove all stubble. So my stubbly right armpit was NOT the fault of the razor, as it turns out, but simply a matter of my holding the razor differently.<br /><br />Speaking of holding the razor, while I still prefer my Venus Embrace overall, I preferred the longer/larger grip area on the Hydro Silk's handle to the shorter/smaller grip area on the Venus Embrace.<br /><br />As for the replaceable shave head, this is where Hydro Silk lost its 5th star. The shaving surface of my Venus Embrace shave head, which has a LOT more wear on it than the Hydro Silk, is still very smooth. Sure, it's lost a bit of its lubricating strip, but there is nothing rough or hard on the shave head. After only 4 weeks of use (and most of it part-time), the white strips at the top and bottom of the shave head are nearly gone, and what remains are what appear to be hard, white bumps of plastic, some of which stick up off the razor head by 1/8&#34;.<br /><br />Both razors have 5 blades and, if you buy the kit that comes with the razor, 2 shave heads and a suction cup hanger for the shower, both cost about 10 bucks here on Amazon.<br /><br />In summary, while the Schick Hydro Silk performs about as well as the Venus Embrace, it will end up being more expensive in the long run because elements of the shave head wear down  more quickly. For my money, I'll stick with the Venus Embrace.<br /><br />4 starsrazor, 2 shave heads and a suction cup hanger for the shower, both cost about 10 bucks here on Amazon.<br /><br />In summary, while the Schick Hydro Silk performs about as well as the Venus Embrace, it will end up being more expensive in the long run because elements of the shave head wear down  more quickly.

Basically it is just a primer similar to Smashbox but less than half the price.

This was her signature scent. I'd always been in thrall of it, but it seemed too complex for my palate - I tended as a younger woman toward simpler scents, white florals etc. But the memory of this perfume, with its difficult to define allure and multiple levels of scent, stayed with me and finally, FINALLY, I broke down and tried it. I hated it on me when I used it the first time - but tried it again the next day. By day three I was hooked. It starts out almost green, like a broken twig, but the drydown has multiple layers and the whole scent changes interestingly through the day. Very difficult for me to identify the individual notes, but if you like a complex, very adult scent that whispers of the Orient, this is one to try.	2014-03-19

I have also found it to be non-irritating; for instance, it's never turned my skin red. Also, the many scents I've tried have been wonderful, and they are long lasting. Your skin will love you for trying this product.	2014-02-04

The Stand does not fit either the razor or the brush. The razor side is to narrow for razor to fit in and the brush side is also to narrow for the brush to fit. I had the tools to modify the openings of both ends so I did a work around. The average person should not have to face this issue. Some people have not mentioned this so it could be a quality control issue. This is not a compatible set. I would give the razor and brush a solid 4…but would downgrade to a 1 to bring attention to this defect.	2013-11-19

Both work well.  This is my favorite combo of the three colors I bought.  I think because there is more contrast.  The polish does what it is supposed to do -- changes color when a top coat is applied.  On the other colors, one coat sufficed.  I recommend using two with this color because it is lighter.  My only concern is with the wear of the color on actual nails since the whole nail can't get a top coat.  I understand China Glaze is one of the higher quality polishes out there so my hope is that not putting a top coat on the whole nail won't make a difference.	2013-07-31

I've always been a loyal customer of Dove when it comes to hair products. For some reason Dove shampoo and conditioner together always work best for my thin, dry and frizzy hair. Before I didn't really have a favorite line from Dove, I would just grab anything that's available when I'm at the grocery store. For the past few mouths I've been using the nourishing oil one and my hair just felt so silky and I also noticed less hair loss. Last week I bought the Daily Moisture shampoo&conditioner (also from Dove) and in just a couple of days my hair got a lot drier and started to fall out a lot more. I'm guessing maybe I really do need intensive treatment since my hair is so dry :( Anyway I'm trying to use up them and I can't wait to go back to this shampoo!!	2013-02-05

I have been using these clippers for about a month now and I am so pleased with them.  I have never owned nice clippers, I have always purchased the cheapies at the gas station or local drug store.  I decided to spend a little extra to get some that will maybe last forever.  They are quality made and so SHARP!  Watch out!  My only complaint would be that they should come with a carrying case, a little pouch or something because if you just throw them in your drawer or makeup bag the next time you go digging for them you may cut yourself on those sharp blades.  I ended up finding a small little padded coin type purse to keep mine in, to protect them and me!	2013-01-26

I know the title says \\\\\"magenta\\\\\" but I was looking more at the picture. I understand color differences but I wasn't expecting it to be AS purple as the picture. But I think this is a legit seller! It's so hard to buy wigs online from China but this seller is not stealing pictures or making false representations.<br /><br />The wig cap feels a bit more snug than other wigs I've purchased (bodyline, gothic lolita wigs, sepia) but that's fine with me. It's pretty sturdy. It's a lot of hair in the ponytails, all the volume is in the ponytails, wearing the base alone might look a bit awkward. But that's fine. I don't know if it's heat resistant, I don't really need to apply heat to it.<br /><br />Also, shipping was from China, but it came much faster than expected. There was little time between when I ordered and when it was posted (I ordered I believe on a Monday morning China time). Packaging was good, but the wig nets everything came in got a little bit tangled while unwrapping. They did a good job though to make sure everything arrived safely. Wig came in sturdy cardboard mailing envelope."	2012-12-11

I am very pleased with the result. My hair is not totally regrown yet, but there is very noticeable extra foliage where there used to be none. I'm hoping in a couple more months it'll be fully regrown, or almost so. In any case, I am pleased and will continue to use it. You figure it's about $5 per month... very much worth it IMO.<br /><br />So, my point is, if you don't see results in two months, don't give up just yet. Also I used it AS DIRECTED, once in the morning and once in the evening every day. Some downsides: it takes FOREVER to dry, so if you think that's going to be a problem, seek alternative measures (if you sort of rub it in with your fingers, it would probably dry faster. I generally just apply drops to the top of my head and leave it at that). I experienced no adverse side effects except a very, very minor itchiness of my scalp. Nothing to cry over at all. I use \\\\\"dry scalp\\\\\" shampoo anyways, so that probably helps with this. Finally, the label will tell you it's for hair loss at the vertex. That is where I am seeing the greatest benefit. HOWEVER I do also notice a small amount of regrowth up front also.<br /><br />Anyways... give it a shot, and good luck!"	2012-09-23

I haven't yet done any layering but this is a nice shimmery pink.<br /><br />This is a UV cured 'gel' polish.  Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.<br /><br />I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer.  Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic 'off brand' gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak so I decided to buy the CND kit & do it myself (also saving me $ in the long run.)  Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day. What a waste to spend all that time painting and drying for it to peel away the next day.  I type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so I am tough on my hands.  Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.  It lasts me about 7-10 days on dark colors, because I chose to take it off when I can see growth at the cuticle.  On many others, it will easily last 2 + weeks	2012-08-26

It stays on and continues to look good all day.  The shadow goes on with the slightest possible shimmer.  I prefer matte shadow and was doubtful I'd like it, but it's really pretty and smooths my mature eye skin so it looks younger.  The light color on the bone of your eyebrow arch opens your eyes and softens the edges of the darker color for a professional look. I'm quite taken with this shadow duo.<br /><br />I've used bareMinerals powder shadows and like them but this is faster to apply and I seem to be able to control the application better.  I use brushes rather than the provided application stick, but it's nice to have in the case if you're traveling and trying to minimize what your carry.<br /><br />I must have a dozen shadows of various brands all nearly the same color, but will toss them now, because this does the job for me more effectively and attractively than my others.  It goes on smoothly and softly and gives me a lovely finished look.	2012-06-27
US	38390468	R3CCJM9Q6F6M3T	B001DYM62C	79957488	TINKLE HAIR CUTTER	Beauty	5	2	3	N	Y	What did I ever do without it?	I'm used to cutting my own hair, which is wavy and very thick. I've tried other razor combs, but I think this one is best, because of the longer cutting edge, the two cutting sides, and the replaceable blades. The price is the best also. The main thing is to use a light stroke and angle the comb so it doesn't take too much hair at once. Requires some getting used to and some caution. Blades are very sharp, so easy on the pressure!<br /><br />I either do a sort of a loose, soft wedge with lots of fringe, a short pixie, or something in between. I start with the Flowbee vacuum-design DIY haircutter to get the basic shape. While it's still wet, I put in some conditioner and razor it carefully all over. Then I rinse and blow-dry my hair more-or-less straight with a paddle brush, put in a silky leave-in conditioner (lots), and flat iron the front. Once it's dry and flat, I can create the detail with the razor comb (without the mistakes that curls would cause), smoothing behind the ears and around the neck, shaping the crown, smoothing from back to front, and framing the face. Once the cut is complete, I can let it curl or flat iron it, either way, because it's a balanced cut.<br /><br />Just the Flowbee alone will leave the hair too chunky and unnatural, at least for thick hair. It's an essential for me, though. The Flowbee site charges less than Amazon for their product. They're based in Houston and will ship by UPS.<br /><br />I've repaired my boyfriend's inexpensive haircuts with this, and it works very well at taking out bumps and ridges that aren't meant to be there. I just have to be sure to put in lots of slick leave-in conditioner, so that it doesn't pull. Also need to be sure the blades are sharp. (Another good way to do this is with a comb and thinning shears--the way the barbers do it, except they use regular scissors for this. You hold the section horizontal with the comb and carefully snip at it with the shears; keep combing down and lifting/snipping until all the bumps are blended out.)<br /><br />Some people say it causes split ends and frizz for them. Doesn't do this for me at all. The thinning shears will make my hair look frizzy and frazzled if I'm not careful (so I rarely use them on myself), but the razor combs never do that to me.<br /><br />Good luck to you, and I hope this helps. It sure saves money, once you're used to it. Also, you'll notice more easily the mistakes a hairdresser makes if you know how to cut your own. You'll want to continue giving yourself that special attention that is so expensive at a salon.l the bumps are blended out.)<br /><br />Some people say it causes split ends and frizz for them.

If you clean the razor every use, as Braun recommends, you'll get maybe 30 cleanings and be done with a single refill in about one month.  Instead, I use the clean cycle only once a week, and stopper the refills in between to prevent evaporation.  Before you clean the razor, get as much hair out of it as you can (e.g. by *carefully* running it under water and/or using a brush).  This will keep the refill from being filled with hair. Then you use the cleaning cycle as normal.<br /><br />After cleaning is done, the razor will be free of hair and have a nice scent.  I've had my starter cartridge since December 2011, and it still shows up green when I put it in the system.	2012-03-28

I have to agree with another reviewer on the scent. I usually don't have a problem with different scents, but I am uncomfortable when it is lotion for the face. For me the smell seems to linger on throughout the day. So far though it has not caused my skin to break out compared to other products that are fragranced. It seems to tighten my skin, but I expected more of a tingly sensation using this product due to it supposedly having 25% glycolic acid. I have another brand of lotion with 12% glycolic acid that I notice working more than this product. Not sure what to think about that. Other than that it is ok, not sure if I will order it again. I would like the product so much more if they would take out the fragrance.	2012-03-12

"The package shown in Amazon's picture has the colors in the wrong order and so they are mis-labelled:<br />* \\\\\"Wocka-wocka\\\\\" is in the correct slot and is an opaque red/magenta.<br />* \\\\\"Designer...de Better!\\\\\" is a silver paint with a smattering of pink glitter.  It's the second from the left in the picture shown.  \\\\\"Designer...de-better!\\\\\" is a denser glitter coat as opposed to the sparkle polishes in the rest of the Muppets collection (e.g., \\\\\"Rainbow Connection\\\\\", \\\\\"Fresh Frog of Bel Air\\\\\"). It is nearly opaque with one coat and fully opaque with two.<br />* \\\\\"Excuse moi\\\\\" is incorrectly slotted in the picture; it's actually the pink glitter color shown in the far right in the picture.  \\\\\"Excuse moi\\\\\" is pink paint with pink glitter throughout.  It is nearly opaque with one coat and fully opaque with two, like \\\\\"Designer...de Better!\\\\\".<br />* Finally, \\\\\"Warm & Fozzie\\\\\" is a rich and light brown color with gold and brown glitter.  It's the third from the left (or second from the right) in the picture shown.<br /><br />As far as the colors they picked for this mini-collection, I'm actually a little disappointed.  The Muppets collection includes several sparkle coats that are awesome, specifically [[ASIN:B005R4TO6K Rainbow Connection]], [[ASIN:B002IFHVMA Fresh Frog of Bel Air]], [[ASIN:B002HXX7WQ Gone Gonzo!]], [[ASIN:B005RFI1YK Divine Swine]], and [[ASIN:B005SH0PLE Gettin' Miss Piggy with It]].

A layer of any of the sparkle coats over \\\\\"Designer...de Better!\\\\\" is really pretty.<br /><br />If you're the kind of person that constantly wants a new nail color, the mini-collections by OPI (like this one) are perfect.  If you're like me, you rarely use a bottle of nail polish more than once or twice.  In that case, you'll have plenty in each of these bottles.  I have yet to make one of them run out.  The one complaint I have is that the applicator brush in the mini-bottles is not the same level of quality as OPI's brushes usually are.  What I suggest is, before you throw away an old bottle of OPI, take out the brush and clean it thoroughly with acetone.  Then, you can use that brush with your mini-bottles and just clean it with nail polish remover after each use.  That way you can get the full coverage of the normal OPI brush while using your (cheaper) mini-polishes.<br /><br />For holiday gifts, it's a great idea to buy these mini-collections and break them up to distribute to a group or use as stocking stuffers.  I do that every year for the women in our family, and we all trade the colors around until we each have ones we like. Keep in mind, though, that the individual mini bottles are not labelled, so people won't know what color they have.

Keep in mind, though, that the individual mini bottles are not labelled, so people won't know what color they have.  You might want to use a gift tag to label the bottles for your recipients in that case."	2011-11-22

Laura Mercier used to have a great cake eyeliner.  Then they updated and ruined their formula and it no longer works well with water to liquify the product.  You now apparently have to buy LM's separate sealer.  Forget that!  I've used Kryolan's cake eyeliners for a long time.  The black is a true, rich jet black.  Mixed with water, it applies creamy and beautifully.  It wears until I take it off.  It's everything that Laura Mercier's used to be.  The package is large and the product lasts a very long time.  I also have Kryolan's cake in brown, but am not as thrilled with its color because it's a very ashy brown.  I wish they'd make it richer.  But the black is amazing.	2011-10-03

I come from Indian subcontinent, a place where kohl kajal is very popular among ladies.  After coming to US, I looked for one for a long time and couldn't find one.  So I had to make the eye pencils work.  I was delighted to find this kohl style kajal on Amazon and bought one right away.  It took some time (about 2.5 weeks) to arrive but I am loving it so far.  It gives a thick and dark line in lower eye; I personally don't like to use it on the lid since t fails to achieve a thin line.	2011-09-17

Body Wash	Beauty	5	0	0	N	Y	Superb moisturizing body wash	I became familiar with this line of bath and moisturizing products at Expo East almost a year ago. I travel all the time and the aiplane air drys out my skin regardless of how much water I drink. I originally used the bath products because my skin was severely dry. These seaweed baths were great and the effects lasted two days. The problem was that on the road , my hotel room either had no bath tub or I was not comfortable sitting in it. This forced me to try the seaweed body wash and the body butters, both of which I love. I am in my 50's and no other products I have tried come close to this line. Both the butters and the body wash keep my skin moisturized for about 12 hours. Well done.[[ASIN:B0013EBM22 Seaweed Bath Salt]]	2011-07-23

I have been darkening them with gels and pencils for years, and have always been self conscious at the pool, etc. Luckily after finding this product-not anymore.  This has been extremely helpful.  I am no longer worried about going in public without \\\\\"my eyebrows on,\\\\\" and not to mention the time it saves me time every day (sometimes multiple times) dealing with them.  I think the eyebrows are the most important part of your face, and I feel so much better to be able to get up and go.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who has to deal with the burden of using gels, pencils, or shadows on a daily basis.  I will say that the directions say to leave it on each eyebrow for two minutes, but I leave it on for four.  My eyebrows are pretty dark afterwards for about a day and a half, but I get longer use out of each application that way.  Also, the box says it lasts six weeks, but with leaving it on for four minutes, I get about a week and a half, or close to two weeks wear out of an application.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and put chapstick on the skin around my eyebrows to keep from staining my skin.  All in all, it takes me about 15 minutes tops every other week or so to dye my brows with this product, which seems a lot better than the ten minutes a day I spent coloring them in.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.  I just ordered the \\\\\"Godefroy Double Lash & Brow Treatment\\\\\" since I love the eyebrow tint so much, so I will be writing a review about it after I give that product a go."	2011-07-23

"My wife and I decided to try 100% pure lanolin as our baby kept getting rashes even with Desitin.  We have been amazed at the versatility of uses for this product - 1) ointment for babies' bottoms; 2) moisturizer for the hands, face, feet, anywhere; 3) great moisturizer for the eyelids and around the eyes in general.... At first I was a little \\\\\"sheepish\\\\\" (ha ha!) about smelling like a sheep.  The stuff does smell a little like sheep but we have actually grown to like the smell well enough.  It is a natural, light smell.  It does not leave any smell on your clothes or face. For instance, I put the moisturizer all over my face before going to bed at night.  In the morning, my face feels good and not greasy.  I believe this is because the lanolin absorbs so well into the skin.  Also, the lanolin leaves no lasting smell on your clothes, sheets, etc.<br /><br />We have been using pure lanolin for our babies' bottoms for over 4 months now, and they have less rashes.  And we have recently ordered 4 more bottles. We also are users of Eucerin, Aquaphor, and good old petroleum jelly but this pure lanolin is much better for moisturizing and getting rid of dryness.  I use aquaphor before going out during the day b/c I don't want to smell \\\\\"sheep-y\\\\\".  My wife loves the stuff and even loves the smell so she has no issues going out with it on....<br /><br />Another thing.... sometimes when my skin feels itchy (i.e. possibly from dryness), I apply the lanolin and this soothes the itch.  Try this product.  It's great!"	2011-04-28

As a bellydancer I frequently wear false eyelashes and was saddened upon developing a latex allergy since almost all lash adhesives are latex based. There is the single lash adhesive, but it dries hard and sharp and is difficult and painful to remove. When I stumbled upon this product, my problem was solved! This is just as flexible as traditional latex based adhesive, and has excellent hold (I've fallen asleep in makeup and my lashes were still secure the next day even after sleeping in them) but is entirely latex free. Even better, because of the narrow application brush, its a snap to apply with no mess and no waste. You simply paint the edge of the lash strip with a thin line of adhesive, let it get tacky and apply.  Latex allergic lash weareres rejoice--there is this fantastic product around to solve your adhesive needs!	2011-04-08

My hair is superfine, and in the winter when it gets all staticky it makes me nuts.  I wind up putting it in a ponytail most of the time because I can't stand the static.  Aveda used to make a wonderful product that really took that static out but they don't make it anymore and none of the others I tried worked either.  I really didn't think a blow dryer could make a difference, and I've only used this a few times since I got it (and I use it with the diffuser on it so I'm not sure if that makes a difference or not) but it REALLY doesn't leave my hair with any static.  Mind you, it doesn't take all the frizz out of my hair (it starts off looking just fine but kind of frizzes as the day wears on) but I bought it for the anti-static, and I'm really pleased with that aspect of it.	2010-12-29

Do you have migraines or Meniere's disease or just have a sensitive head? Don't get any of the pulsating Oral B brushes. They will just make you nauseous or trigger a headache.<br /><br />I have used the classic Oral B electric brush for many years. A fantastic simple white design by Braun of Germany - since discontinued after Braun was bought by an American company. Now I have the simple low end non pulsing model. Essentially the same guts and head as the classic but with an ugly, over stylized, blue body.<br /><br />When the battery started to die on my classic model, I picked up a pulsating Oral B. It is really banging away at your teeth and does as good a job as the non pulsatinging. But it vibrates your jaw and skull like, well, a vibrating electric tooth brush! After a month, it was just too much for me. I went back to the dieing battery original, but soon got its replacement as a gift.<br /><br />The verdict: I'm in my 40s and I've had about 6 different dentists (moving from job to job) in 5 different states. One was a professor at a dental college. After each visit, they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape. I use the cheapest Oral B electric brush (non pulsating) in the morning and before bed with Colgate Total. I also floss just one time before bed and use the Crest rinse for night time. I get them cleaned every 6-9 months.<br /><br />Save your money and get the cheapest Oral B electric toothbrush. I think it is on sale sometimes for about $10.	2010-10-29

I've been using steam setters for over ten years, and the Vidal Sassoon is the better of the two brands I've used.  However, the main complaint I have about steam setters, including this one, is that they don't last for more than a year or two.  I used to be OK with that when they were about half the price, but, with what I consider to be an exhorbitant price, it will get very expensive when I have to replace this one.  I don't quite understand what makes these things so expensive.<br /><br />Also, I'd like to be able to buy just the unit,because with my short hair, I can't even use most of the rollers that come with it. In fact, I have to go online to find the smallest rollers they have.<br /><br />All that being said, I still like this method of doing hair because it really does work.  So, I guess I'll continue to bite the bullet and buy another one when this one dies on me.	2009-09-02

As always Miss Fuse's boxes are beautifully finished both inside and out and choosing the correct paper can add a great deal to the quality of the finished product.<br /><br />These little boxes consist of a number of sheets of paper slotted together to form each part and some are really not that easy to do.  The flower box and some of the other decorative tops are quite tricky to figure out and absolute accuracy is required in the folding.  Having said this I have made most of the boxes in the book and the instructions are in Miss Fuse's clear and easy to follow style.  All of the boxes are made up and photographed clearly in the book, both in a separate sumptuous gallery section and in black and white photographs alongside the instructions.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for a complete beginner but someone who has done some folding and has mastered the basic models should be able to manage and enjoy making most of the items in it.	2005-10-09

Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\\\\"Lord of the Rings.\\\\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\\\\"best book\\\\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\\\\"Star Wars.\\\\\"<br /><br />Following up on events in \\\\\"The Hobbit,\\\\\" \\\\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\\\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\\\\"The Two Towers\\\\\" begins directly after \\\\\"Fellowship,\\\\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\\\\"Return of the King\\\\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\\\\"Lord of the Rings\\\\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\\\\"Lord of the Rings\\\\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it.rd of the Rings\\\\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.

The authors don't sugarcoat or minimize the problems and are quite candid that people in need of their advice face a lifetime of continual work to keep from falling back into the woulda/coulda/shoulda traps.

While, I don't usually like to be called endangered, I could completely relate to the description of the troubles our generation is going through- how we have it worse off financially than our parents did in their twenties, and how that explains why we are floating in this in-between stage. This is happening just at the developmental stage in our lives when we'd feel a lot better if we had more financial freedom and didn't have to ask our parents for help. The stresses of dating, not being able to afford more than a cheap apartment (or worse- having to move back in with our parents), and being educated but in a competitive job market, take their toll. At this age, our parents were already married, owned their own home, and had a stable job. So things have changed a lot, and it helps to know that! It frees you to accept society as it is today and make the most of it. She ends the section with a positive prediction that our generation, expecting the least out of life after our disappointing start at adulthood, will end up very successful and appreciating what we have more than other generations. Sheehy is very insightful."	2005-08-08

The mechanics of the court system are not, for most people, comprehensible, much less exciting. Here, Levin provides solid scholarship accessible to the average person.<br /><br />  Levin does well in explaining and demonstrating how the Supreme Court - and all levels of our courts - have strayed from the intent of the Founders and established themselves as an unelected government superior in their own minds to the legislative and executive branches of government.<br /><br />  There can be no doubt of the accuracy of Levin's argument. The problem of \\\\\"Men In Blsck\\\\\" lies in Levin's adoption of certain cases and movements as evidence. For example, Levin chastises the  Court for holding that burning the American flag is protected under the First Amendment. Well, I consider myself a conservative - and I agree with the Court. There are simply some issues that resonable people can disagree on, but Levin doesn't seem to allow that latitude. This is regrettable, because generally Levin's arguments are strong. Likewise, Levin allows himself to get wrapped up in Roe v. Wade and the entire abortion issue. There are many people, like myself, who believe that the legal reasoning in Row v. Wade is lacking, if not entirely non-existent. Yet it is possible at the same time for even conservatives to believe the ultimate holding is correct. In fact, I know that I am not alone in believing that abortion does constitute the taking of a human life, but that government has absolutely no right to dictate what a woman may do with regard to her own body. In other words, Roe v. Wade is simply not a good way to illustrate the truth of Levin's theme that \\\\\"the Supreme Court is destroying America.\\\\\" It is: but Roe v. Wade is not likely to get the majority of people to agree with that premise.<br /><br />  As I said, I wish I could offer \\\\\"Men In Black\\\\\" higher praise, but I think Levin picked the wrong way to illustrate by choosing polarizing examples. There are numerous other Supreme Court decisions he could have used that would have brought home the point that courts in general need to be reined in and brought under the control of the people, as the Founders intended.<br /><br />Jerryds, Roe v.

"I started reading Frank Harris' memoirs with a great deal of interest.  He'd come to Chicago as a fresh-faced, enthusiastic Irish kid, \\\\\"straight off the boat\\\\\", but through hard work and personal service had commended himself to some Westerners with whom he soon became partners.  Pretty good for a hotel bellhop !  But still, maybe it could have been true.  Then, he rode off for eighteen months' adventures in Texas and New Mexico, purchasing, raiding, and driving cattle, sprinkled with gunfights with the Indians, duels and horseraces with Mexican grandees, and the hijinks of bored cowboys.  Miraculous escapes and great physical feats abound.  As I read, I began to feel that some o' these here scenes was a mite familiar.  Sure enough, I decided, I'd definitely spotted them in Hollywood movies.  Frank Harris' life resembled a movie, sure as shootin'.  At last I reached the point where after escaping a possible Indian attack, as he and his companions drove a huge herd north through Texas, he intoned that just a few years later, General Custer and his men were wiped out by the same Indians close to that very spot.  Well, sir, I may be a sucker, but I ain't that big of a one !  As I recall from my school days, the Little Big Horn was way up in Montana, or it used to be.  Shoot, I guess you never can tell.  But still, I got plumb suspicious.  I looked on the internet.  Seems Frank Harris had raised a few doubts in others' minds too.  Maybe because at the time when he said he was fightin' Indians and ridin', ropin' and shootin', he was only around five years old !

His maps were used by James Cook and Horatio Nelson, among others; his work as a naturalist influenced von Humboldt and Darwin, and his writings stirred the imagination of Defoe, Coleridge and Swift. He circumnavigated the world three times and was the first Englishman to explore Australia.<br /><br />It was William Dampier's lifelong ambition to achieve wealth and fame. Though he found some of the latter before his death he was frustrated at almost every turn in his efforts to accomplish the former and, sadly, died in debt.<br /><br />Diana and Michael Preston have given the man his due in their biography, \\\\\"A Pirate of Exquisite Mind.\\\\\"<br /><br />Dampier was a man of his time and, thus, is not without fault in the modern view. But he had more tolerance than many of his contemporaries, despised superstition and saw curiosity about the world around us as among the highest of virtues.<br /><br />For a man whose writing had (and continues to have) so much influence on so many others, it is surprising that William Dampier is largely forgotten, even in his birthplace of East Coker, Somerset. Before this long overdue biography, the Prestons found almost everything known about Dampier came from his published books. None of his original journals have survived.<br /><br />The Prestons searched out manuscripts in the British Library and moldering papers in various record offices and then went one better than many biographers, actually visiting the many places his path took him around the world.<br /><br />There are aspects of his life the authors only skimmed over and which I wish they had given more attention. While not quite as readable as \\\\\"Blue Latitudes,\\\\\" the Tony Horwitz book on Cook, I found much to admire in this book.to admire in this book. <br /> <br /> <br />"	2005-04-30

I got this book, as well as Game Character Development in Maya, at the same time, so it made it a little easier to review this book in comparison. <br />I am just starting out with Maya, taking courses on 3DBuzz, playing with the PLE version of Maya, so I really should have read the title of this book a few times to let it sink in. This is a book for CURRENT GAME ARTISTS. This is NOT really a book for people just starting out with Maya. The author does not explain a lot of what he's doing as far as theory goes, because he's assuming that you already KNOW the theory, and are just moving your skills to Maya. This is not a bad thing, of course, but caveat emptor for the n00b like myself you buys this assuming your going to be led by the hand. For those people, I highly recommend the previously mentioned 'Game Character Development in Maya'. <br />I'm NOT knocking this book!!! It seems like a really good one for the audience it's intended for, and I'll probably put it on my bookshelf until I get good enough to see what the author is trying to say. I just wanted to throw this out for those, like myself, that might be thinking it's a beginner's guide, which it surely isn't.	2005-04-19

It is easy to read, and starts with an easy to follow guide to cognitive theories of attention.  Teh the author describes various assessments which have been used to assess attention and control.  Finally, the author goes on to describe the research findings showing how attention skills can break down in various disorders.  The chapter on ADHD was very interesting to me.  Also, the chapter neural network theories was understandable and a useful guide to evaluting this kind of approach. <br /> <br />I have also used this book with some of my undergraduate classes, where it has been very well received.  The introduction to attention works especially well, and many students are interested to read about how conditions such as dementia can affect this aspect of behaviour. <br /> <br />Given all of this, I think the book is of exceptional value.  Few academic books come in at less than 20 dollars these days.  I recommend it to psychology students at all levels.	2005-02-16

It does not hold academia high above your head and expects you to understand what the book has to say.  The book doesn't just say that Genesis is correct and that's that.  It goes deep into each and every argument of the evolution lie and dismantles each and every one of them a step at a time.  A book like this is important because evolution...the lie and the racist idea that it is...is practically stapled to our schools and our universities.  The concept of an Intelligent Design/er is realistic, scientific, and worthy of accepting.  Only those who hate Christians and Christianity will go against such a book, and I do know many of those...they cling to the idea of evolution but this \\\\\"scientific idea\\\\\" is like sand that slowly slides through the palm of their hands.  The concept of evolution holds no true ground.  If you truly look at it, you realize just how foolish it is.<br /><br />Christians need books like this and books like those of Hugh Ross that shows the foolishness of atheism and humanism evolution.  The mere thought that evolution could exist on what is referred to as a macroevolution scale is absurd.  Then there's the realization that evolution itself has so many different types of hypothesis shows that there is no firm groundwork.  However, if you take cosmic design and human design, bringing them all together facing you, you realize that the Bible is right.  That there is a Creator and we and the universe around us are the created.  Do you not realize the following as stated in this book?<br /><br />This book follows the thought pattern of the apostle Paul.  We need to examine the evidence for the Bible before us, so that we can bring intelligence to the debate...not just arguing \\\\\"I'm right and you are wrong\\\\\" and that's that.  By examining the evidence, by truly keeping an open mind while exploring books like Dismantling Evolution and Hugh Ross's Fingerprint of God, we realize that our Christian faith is a wall that cannot be brought down.  The final thought by the author, Ralph Muncaster, shows an important truth:<br /><br />  \\\\\"In essence, this challenge [the one faced by evolutionists today] means a change of faith from one unseen to another.  No one has ever seen evolution in action.  Nor has anyone ever seen an intelligent designer such as God.  Both require faith.  Faith in the nothing of evolution leads us to despair.  Belief in the God of intelligent design leads us to great hope...Those who cast off the weights of evolutionary presuppositions can scale that final peak and find peace in an intelligent-designer God--a real God that has beautifully and wonderfully crafted all living things He's waiting for evolutionists to find him--and the hope he can bring them all\\\\\" (224).th is a wall that cannot be brought down.

Richly written and descriptive to the point of excellence (not overboard droning on), this story moves at a good pace that keeps the reader interested but not riveted to the point where you are running home to read or will stay up past your bed time. What I enjoyed about this book was the fact that you get to know the main characters well and get to see their many sides. I also liked the descriptive narratives of the setting that made you feel like you were almost there, sweating on the bus and restless with anticipation to get to the beach and try Maximillano's famous cooking.

There are numerous stories, and many of them are quite creepy. On the other hand, the photos were less impressive. I am by no means an expert in photography, but I must say in all honesty that some of the photos included in this book appeared to be faked (and badly at that). This, in my opinion, somewhat compromised the credibility of the rest of the book. Apart from that, \\\\\"Real Ghosts\\\\\" still makes for a good read, especially on a dark and stormy night. In addition to this book, I highly recommend \\\\\"A Witch's Guide to Ghosts and the Supernatural\\\\\" by Gerina Dunwich.

"Janet Evanovich has launched a new set of characters in what could be a decent series in Metro Girl.  Although it's not perfect, it could grow into a decent run...<br /><br />Alex \\\\\"Barney\\\\\" Barnaby gets a strange call from her brother, \\\\\"Wild\\\\\" Bill Barnaby, that leads her to believe he's in significant danger.  She heads down to Miami and the Keys to track him down and find out if he needs rescuing.  She quickly hooks up with a NASCAR driver, Sam Hooker, aka \\\\\"The NASCAR Guy\\\\\", because he knows Bill and Bill has taken off with his boat.  As they start trying to track down Bill's movements and location, they quickly find that they are not the only ones looking for Bill.  Some unsavory types also want to find Bill, and they probably want to kill him rather than just talk.  At the end, she needs to figure out who are good guys and bad guys...<br /><br />The problem that Evanovich faces here is her own success.  The Stephanie Plum series is well established and is loved by the readers.  The character development is deep, and the story lines have matured since the initial episode.  By trying to launch a new series, people expect the same experience as the latest Plum novel, and that's not very realistic.  Is this a perfect novel?  No.  There's obviously a lot we don't know about Barney, and the sexual tension between her and Hooker has to start somewhere.  Could this be a good series over time?  I believe so.  I think the characters are funny and interesting, and with some development time over two or three books, it could start to come close to the success of the Plum series.<br /><br />I think it's worth reading, and it's an entertaining diversion.  If you don't keep trying to compare it to her other works, then you'll enjoy it.  If you attempt to make it an extension of the Plum series, you'll have a problem."	2005-01-15

It's difficult to read, it's boring, it's condescending, and by the time you're several pages into a character's monologue in which the character says the same thing in a different way in each paragraph, you just want to escape this awful book. <br /> <br />I'm well aware I'm going against the mainstream here, but I just dont' see what's so great about this awful book.	2004-12-21

"Diane Perkins brings an interesting, intriguing twist to the \\\\\"marriage of convenience\\\\\" theme in her first U.S. release, THE IMPROPER WIFE. <br /> <br />Captain John Grayson, known to his friends as Gray, is a man of means - but is also a haunted man.  Gray was disowned by his father when he decided to enlist.  He drinks himself to sleep each night, trying to forget his young, pregnant wife who died.  Despite his best attempts, visions of her tragic death haunt his dreams.  One morning, he's awakened by a pounding on his door and opens it to find a lovely, but obviously pregnant woman asking for Captain Grayson. Before he can clarify the obvious error, her child insists on being born, almost immediately. Gray has little choice but to help her deliver her baby boy. <br /> <br />Maggie Delaney believes she has murdered her husband, Captain John Grayson, when she pushed him into a river during an altercation. Alone, pregnant and left with minimal funds, she struggles to survive - until she reads in a discarded paper that Captain Grayson has returned to London. Surprised that her husband is still alive, she learns his whereabouts from the Regimental offices, and then rushes to his quarters, only to be told by a man whose dark looks remind her of a pirate that he is Captain John Grayson.  She has little time to pursue the man's lies when her baby insists on being born. And until she discovers the truth behind Gray's lies, she provides a false identity, that of Maggie Smith. <br /> <br />After the child's birth, Maggie continues to insist that she is Captain Grayson's wife. Annoyed, yet reminded of his personal loss as he watches her hold her new baby son, Gray doesn't have the heart to send her away. Instead, he places her in the charge of his cousin Harry and Harry's wife, Baroness Tess Caufield, with instructions for Tess to deliver Maggie back to her proper home, wherever that might be. He leaves funds with Harry for Maggie's intermediate care, then returns to duty. <br /> <br />Harry and Tess find Gray's request somewhat suspect. Who wouldn't, when the young, beautiful female he claims is a stranger is holding an infant? They take her to their home and, as Tess helps Maggie unpack, she finds papers revealing the marriage of Maggie Delaney to John Grayson. Now convinced that Gray has deserted his wife and child, Harry and Tess decide to take Maggie and her infant to Gray's family estate and Gray's father, Lord Summerton.  Maggie, homeless and alone, agrees for the sake of her son. <br /> <br />Gray returns to London, only to discover that Maggie is at his family estate and has insinuated herself in his family's lives.  Has she does this for financial gain?  Or is she really the caring person she pretends to be?  Gray resolves to discover the truth behind these questions - and more. <br /> <br />THE IMPROPER WIFE is a fast-paced, captivating, not-to-be-missed Regency novel.  I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense in the story, the fully developed characters. Maggie's pain, her determination to provide her son - her only living relative - with a home, was thoroughly engrossing.  Gray's feeling of loss after his older brother's death, his father's banishment, and his initial distrust of Maggie were totally believable. THE IMPROPER WIFE is a real keeper!   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Linda Morelli, multi award-winning author of FIERY SURRENDER and SHADOW OF DOUBT"	2004-10-22

Lucky fer me I got a trans-lay-ter program.<br /><br />*Click* There.<br /><br />Graham's thesis, if this were a dissertation, is that The South, defeated in war, was victorious in its ideas. How so?

Surprised? Not me. But I'm astonished the author was. He must have missed the press releases of Oral Roberts himself ascending the Golden Tower (yes, there is such a thing). I guess he couldn't get a bus ticket to some Jesuit institution.<br /><br />Graham offers the Florida mayor, Carolyn Risher, who signed a proclamation two years ago on city letterhead declaring that Satan was officially banned. Goofy? Sure. Goofy on the level of the Pilgrims who escaped religious persecution for the freedom to practice a little persecution of their own with the Salem witch trials in Massachusetts.

He has made it his speciality to examine the lives of the French, their customs and habits in a witty, humourous and often very personal way. <br /> <br />The focus of his attention here is the French obsession with food - the making and cooking of it, the ingredients, and of course the eating of it, one that he himself coincidentally shares. He intends to satisfy his curiousity by going on a wild romp through many of the strangest food events France has to offer. From a trip to a festival celebrating Frogs Legs (where he is enthroned as an honarary taster), to a church service dedicated to the venerable and hidden majesty of the truffle, to another festival honouring the other French staple the snail, and my personal favourite one involving a wine tasting marathon, each story is supremely funny and wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br />This book, which is basically made up of several self-contained stories, is a delightful treat. At its length however, it is more akin to a extremely delightfully crafted appetizer, rather than a full wholesome main course. That said, it does whet ones appetite, and leaves you longing for more. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-07-30

I found the questions and exams at the end of each lesson to be of special value, allowing the beginner to look back and keep their knowledge sharp. (Though I have studied for more than a decade, read many books and am a founder of a coven, and a teacher myself, I still found Buckland's book to be informative and use from it extensively in my teaching.) <br />  <br /> I've read the other reviews of this book and found myself wondering if one or two reviewers even read the book. Buckland does tend to teach from the Celtic-Saxon tradition, as that is where his training and early study was focused. He does not, however, limit himself or the reader to that orientation, actively encouraging students and Witches to study many different traditions, as he has (including his own Seax Wicca tradition and his inherited Gypsy Tradition). One must begin somewhere, and this is an excellent first book for those who have gotten beyond the looking stage and are ready to learn the workings of the craft. <br />  <br /> Special attention is paid to proper mechanics of casting a circle, &quot;calling quarters&quot; and many other things necessary for safe magick. There are lessons on herbs, dedication and initiation rites, coven work, and solitary practice. I highly recommend it to the beginner and teacher.	2004-07-30

"I bought this book in order to prevent pregnancy, because I want off the pill. As a 23-year-old in a stable, monogamous relationship who is concerend about side effects and long term effects of synthetic hormones, I highly recommend this book!<br />I shied away from some other \\\\\"natural birth control\\\\\" books due to religious overtones - they tend to make me uncomfortable. This book is just chock-full of info about keeping track of your cycle and knowing when you're fertile, when you're not, and all the biological reasoning behind fertility. Sex education in my school gave the impression that you can get pregnant ANY TIME! I guess they were trying to scare us away from having unprotected sex PERIOD.<br />It really is a shame that this method isn't promoted more strongly at places like Planned Parenthood, where I first went in search of birth control and continued going to until a few months ago. Even when I brought up switching to a non-hormonal birth control method at that last appointment, I was presented only with barrier methods, and even the NuvaRing and IUD, both of which have hormones! <br />Perhaps I should write another review after using what I've learned for a year or so to say how it's worked for me, since I can't accurately chart (not technically ovulating and cervical fluid is altered).

It means meeting people where they live and engaging them in such a way that they leave the encounter feeling they were deeply nourished.

The title &#34;Embers&#34; makes this reader think of a smoldering fire - one either ready to die out-- or ready to be reawakened  - into a full blazing *fire*. Indeed, the metaphor fits, the unexpected shock of *what* it is that could erupt into a flame and why the title fits, becomes cystal clear about half-way thorugh the book. Similar to Franz Kafka, Marai builds a personal tension that becomes an existential experience, a psychological conundrum - for the General (Henrik). The General has lived with certain questions - questions he needs answered.<br /><br />The book begins with the General describing his boyhood friendship with Konrad. The friendship began in military school during the Austro-Hungarian empire. The General was of an upper class background, Konrad's parents sold their land and lived on the edge of poverty to provide their son, an advantage in life. The General's father made an observation about Konrad, the first time he visited their home. Konrad was playing a Chopin piece with Henrik's mother, when Henrik's father made a very telling observation about Konrad, &#34;He is different kind of man&#34;. This observation sets up the mystery which the book gradually, very gradually reveals. It is the reason why the book is so intriguing and fascinating. The reader wants to discover  why is Konrad 'different'. Just what does this mean?<br /><br />The General is preparing his castle for Konrad's visit. The friends are going to reunite after 41 years of separation. Although, they remained on the best of terms as the closest of friends for 24 years - something happened - it made Konrad leave, without a word. The General needed to know, why did Konrad take off with no word of good-bye- to explore the world. Konrad often stayed at the General's castle and dined with the General and his wife, Krisztina. This reader suspected that somehow Krisztina held the key to his unexpected and unexplained departure. However there is a deeper unexplained ... primitive ... dark secret ... waiting to be unraveled. It is revealed in elegant prose. The book is deeply moving and filled with suspense, a mesmerizing experience. Erika Borsos (erikab93)dark secret ... waiting to be unraveled.

Victor Davis Hanson's book is absolutely superb however he backs away from presenting solutions to the all too numerous problems associated with the alarming increase in illegal Mexican aliens. Forcible deportation along with the revocation of citizenship of children born to illegal Mexican aliens combined with a complete and total forfeiture of all property would substantially increase the quality of life within America. It would be in America's best interest to take the confiscated property (homes, businesses, cars, cash, etc.,) and redistribute these essentially ill-gotten gains to America's black population as a means of reparation for the sins of slavery. African-Americans have been consistently getting the shaft for over four hundred years and they are the ones most adversely affected by the illegal Mexican alien invasion. They are taking the jobs that would rightfully belong to black Americans. The unemployment rate amongst black American males is close to fifty per cent and yet every illegal Mexican alien in this country is working two and three jobs each. A far more viable solution would be to enforce America's current immigration laws by deporting anyone who is in this country illegally and to redress black America's grievances by restoring what should have rightfully been theirs by giving them the forfeited property. Contrary to what other reviewers may opine, there is nothing inherently wrong with being &quot;anti-Mexican&quot; - the great thing about the USA is that we have the right of free speech and association and consequently, no one is forced to think that Mexicans are God's chosen people (contrary to what the Catholic Church may think, but that's a topic for a different review). African-Americans are once again being shunted aside and that is something that needs to be addressed. Every gain made by an illegal Mexican alien is a gain that is deprived from a black American. African-Americans have been victimized in this country for over four hundred years and they shouldn't have to take a back seat to someone who's been here for fifteen minutes. Every cent that goes to illegal Mexican aliens in social services (welfare, medical, scholarships, etc) is money that is essentially taken out of the pockets of other more-deserving Americans. Mr. Hanson clearly brings the issues to light but he needs to present a sledge-hammer-like solution. I highly recommend this book to all readers. It would appear that the one issue that may finally unite whites and blacks is their need to join forces to ensure their continued survival against the unrelenting Hispanic onslaught. First-rate book that should be purchased along with &quot;Alien Nation&quot; by Peter Brimelow and anything by Pat Buchanan.	2004-02-13

Humans and other animals have long contended for living space, but the North American experience is nearly unique.  Our dealings with wild life, plant and animal, have swung from nearly absolute exploitation and extinction to various versions of preserve and protect.  Both attitudes have been clouded by ignorance and misunderstanding.  David Baron vividly and expertly examines these views.  He explains how one community, Boulder, Colorado, has become a model for a new view of  coexistence with our fellow creatures.  It may have taken the inadvertant sacrifice of one young man to show how our relationship with wilderness must be reconsidered and recast.<br />Baron's science journalist's skills grant him the role of emissary, crisscrossing the border between the human and cougar communities.  He carefully observes the lifestyle of the New West inhabitant.  &quot;White, wealthy and progressive&quot; suburban Boulder came to typify a new term in biology - the &quot;ecotone&quot;.  Ecotones are the interface of humanity and wilderness.  Homes at town's edge, open lawns and gardens attracting deer, jogging paths over isolated ridges and remote canyons are a novel environment.<br /><br />Cougars, once fearful of men, and dogs, followed their usual prey of deer into this zone.  In doing so, they adapted to conditions readily.  Baron demonstrates the falsity of many myths surrounding the cougar.  They are highly adaptive creatures, even possessing a &quot;culture&quot; few humans recognise, let alone understand.  They feared the wolf packs encountered in the past, but quickly learned pet dogs are no threat.  And cougar mothers taught their cubs Fido could provide a meal.  Once thought to follow fixed movement patterns, cougars are now recognized as random patrollers of territory.  To humans, this unpredictability poses an unexpected threat.  It's led to attacks on people - in Boulder, it led to the death of an eighteen-year-old student.<br />This captivating account of how awareness of the ecotone emerged is flawless.  There are heroes, villians, people whose views are challenged and reactions to new provocations.  The hero of this story is not the slaughtered youth, Scott Lancaster, but Michael Sanders, wildlife &quot;manager&quot;.  Sanders, and colleague Jim Halfpenny, struggled to understand what was happening in the Boulder ecotone.  They recorded cougar sightings and activity, trying to formulate a picture of puma behaviour.  They anticipated potential threats while appealing to government agencies to assist them in their work - to no avail.  Local politics and attitudes intervened.  Even a direct attack on a woman failed to budge preconceptions.  The result was the sacrifice of a young man on the alter of ignorance and misunderstanding.  Baron urges that this sacrifice not be in vain.<br />His conclusion suggests the ecotone isn't limited to the Colorado mountains.  Wolves, racoons, coyotes and even geese are invading marginal habitats at the edge of human settlements.  A cougar was struck by a car in Kansas City.  Another surprised a strolling couple in Minneapolis.  A coyote strode onto a verandah near Boston.  Baron doesn't propose a return to bounty hunting.  He respects the needs of the rest of the animal kingdom, even predators.  What is needed, he urges, is an informed, pragmatic approach to wilderness preservation.  With the &quot;outbreak&quot; of humans intruding on much of the planet, new forms of wildlife management must be applied.  This will require resources [your tax dollars], study [more students taking up wildlife study] and political will [no simple answers].<br />Baron romanticises nothing in his narrative.  His realistic approach is almost unique in nature writing.  Certainly, his championing a new view of how we approach the rest of nature must be heeded.  He is clearly aware of the massive education process that must ensue to prevent more killings.  He stands almost in a &quot;no-man's land&quot; between those thinking &quot;nature&quot; must remain unblemished and those who urge further exploitation.  He takes what is perhaps the most unpopular stance in America today - arguing for further knowledge and understanding before decisions are taken.  In these times, one of those decisions is where to place the next new suburban house.  Perhaps yours.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]more killings.

The figure reputed to be Mary Magdalene is actually the beloved disciple John, who is usually depicted young and clean-shaven.<br />Were Jesus and Mary M. married?<br />Although there is no way to prove or disprove this, most experts consider it highly unlikely. Their main argument: there is no mention of it in canonical writings.<br />Was Mary M. a prostitute?<br />This misperception probably began with a sermon by Pope Gregory the Great in A.D. 591 in which he conflated several figures into one. In 1969 the Vatican officially overruled Gregory.<br />Are Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion real organizations?<br />Yes, but there is no indication that either is involved in any plot to conceal or reveal secrets of the Holy Grail.<br />What is the Holy Grail?<br />The most widely accepted idea is that it was the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper. Others have hypothesized that it was a secret book. In the 12th century a French abbot claimed to possess it; his silver chalice now resides in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.<br />Did male leaders cover up the true role of women in the early church?<br />Yes, in the sense that history is written by the winners, and in a patriarchal society, men had a big edge.<br />What happened to Mary M. after the Resurrection?<br />Nobody knows.

Not the best &quot;woman&quot; writer, but the best overall.  She has developed a set of characters over several books, including &quot;Fit to Be Tied&quot; and &quot;Regime.&quot;  This time Amber Oakley is the protaginist.  Ms. Oakley, who prefers women but enjoys the humiliation of people forced to perform with men, describes her thoughts and actions in details that rivet the reader.  Of course, the reader understands that it is fantasy and all in fun.  But the willing suspension of disbelief should carry the reader from first line to last.  Especially interesting is the &quot;paint ball&quot; contests Ms. Birch introduced in &quot;Regime,&quot; and which also appear in &quot;Fit to be Tied.&quot;  This may be an emerging fantasy (as seen by the controversy caused by pranksters in Nevada who claimed to have a real shooting gallery.&quot;  Ms. Birch likes her female characters to be hunted, netted, and then &quot;forced&quot; to do whatever the winner demands.

Flashbacks in the novel provide an insight of the author's personality and attitude toward those around him. Some people might find the first part of the novel complicated to read because of its mainly historical content but in my opinion it is essential in order to understand the author's character, ideas, and feelings. Life experiences shape our personality and indirectly determine our beliefs and actions.<br />The novel also emphasizes the clash of cultures experienced by the author and his family who, unlike the author refused to leave behind a past of struggle and hardships but carried on family traditions that sought to influence the author's decisions regarding his future, especially his romantic life. Throughout the novel, the author faces the disapproval of his close-minded, racist, and unforgiving parents who disagreed with his new culture and with the girl he chose to love, Millie. Although the novel narrates many distressing experiences, it is inspiring and optimistic since it shows that in real life there are such things as happy endings.	2003-12-04

Perhaps some of the concepts of persistence are missed by the first reviewer in context of .NET and certainly with the impending object-spaces microsoft technology much of this may be moot. I certainly do believe that GUI's are very much tied to the business model (ESPECIALLY in .NET apps) and I have benefited tremendously in perspective by applying the database conceptually as another view to my business model.<br />At any rate, excellent theory and interesting approaches to implementing a persistence architecture.

Iconographically, it draws on the incredibly complicated Tibetan (Vajrayana) Buddhist pantheon, in which innumerable gods, originally from Hindu India, are first recycled through the esoteric doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism, then redoubled to add their Tibet-specific divine consorts and guardians, and finally redoubled again to add all the monks, lamas, arhats, founders, and followers of each of four major monastic (teaching) orders and their many sub-lineages.<br />Fortunately, we have Fisher's book to help guide us and start to make sense of it all. The author begins with an overview of the Tibetan pantheon - Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Protectors, revered humans - and goes on to review the major forms of expression in architecture, painting, and sculpture. These are followed by a chronological survey of the art of Tibet, from the 11th to the 19th centuries. The book contains 180 illustrations, half of which are in color. Many of the black-and-white photographs depict wonderful objects which, sadly, have not survived into the present day.<br />Because there is so much detail in Tibetan painting, the small format of the illustrations (page size 6&quot; x 8&quot;) can be a disadvantage. Another caution is that a book this size (200 pages) can't possibly answer all the questions that even a beginner might have. Within its size limitations, however, the author has done a good job of illustrating and discussing the essentials of this art; the book is a real bargain at the price. I used it as a quick &quot;refresher&quot; before seeing  the &quot;Himalayas&quot; exhibit (2003, Sackler Gallery, Washington, DC), and in general I think the book would be helpful and enjoyable to just about anyone who is looking for an introduction or review of the art of Tibet.	2003-10-23

Doesn't anyone care anymore? This is the important stuff, folks. Hard facts and important ideas on the issues that are vital to our future are being drowned out by the legions of bickering, partisan loudmouths with an axe to grind. This book is one of the dying breed that is not for only conservatives or only liberals but for AMERICANS, lest we forget we're all in this together. Highlights for me included the essays, such as Paul Kruger's &quot;For Richer,&quot; that reveal how the interests of the wealthy have hijacked our government to a degree never seen before and why our politicians play along, despite overwhelming public opinion against it and the damage it does to our country. Also recommended is Robert Kuttner's reminder of all the promises George W. Bush made to us during his campaign opposed to what he's actually delivered. There could hardly be more distance between the two. Since it helps to know something about your reviewer, I'll tell you that I'm a Democrat, but you'll find a mix of serious conservative, liberal and independent voices here, though not from the extreme fringes. There's no shortage of other books you can look to if that's your thing. Left, right or center, you will find that the writers whose essays make up this book care deeply about which they write and that's what we could all use a lot more of; more caring and less squawking. If you care about your country but are tired of the shrill war of words and conspiracy theories that pass for political writing these days, this book is a beacon in the dark night.	2003-10-12

Thousands of people had their brains mutilated and personalities destroyed in a grand experiment to cure schizophrenia and other mental disorders. What's so incredible is that scientists and physicians, principally Walter Freeman in the book, advocated this procedure based on theories of the brain and mental disorders without much evidence to support their claims. In fact, the theories are almost an afterthought to justifiy the procedure. I'm absolutely amazed at the breathtaking irresponsibility of the medical and psychiatric communities allowed this to go on. Valenstein starts the book by tracing the history of physical \\\\\"cures\\\\\" from water treatment to electroshock therapy.  What Valenstein proves is that lobotomy is really just another attempt by the psychiatric communitiy to apply specualtive theory and boldly experiment on human beings. This was possible because serious mental disorders, like schizophrenia, seemed hopeless. The medical community and public was willing to try anything. In this context, Valenstein explains the driving forces that helped lobotomy to gain wide popularity: the medical profession's willingness to try anything and uncritical acceptance of advocates' claims of success - even giving the inventor of the procedure a Nobel Prize; the media's fascination with strange medical procedures and the almost universal blind acceptance of doctor's claims; and finally, the public institutions' desire to save money - lobotomized patients were released from institutions or were easier to handle. As a layman, I assume scientists are objective and critical thinkers and, doctors are humane heroes - \\\\\"to do no harm\\\\\". This book demolishes those illusions and keeps your skeptical mind razor sharp."	2003-09-17

Filled with allegory and farcical situations reminiscent of Jean Genet and William S. Borroughs she tells of a sexually ambiguous surgeon named Handel; a mentally and physically molested woman artist named Picasso; and the poet Sappho who shares a train ride with the other two. What ensues is a history of each carefully developed character and how they intertwine with the others, unbeknownst to themselves. In turn misconseptions of literature, art, sex, and poetry are placed on the slab to be dissected with each of their lives. Art, she says is not meant to reflect life; a life which cannot help but reflect our own escape from adolescence. Rather, art is a product of imagination which creates its own rules and laws. The conclusion is so satisfying I was disappointed only that Winterson's fantastic imagery and play of light, color, and depth had to come to and end.	2003-08-17

This book will become a classic like the GoF book. I agree with the other reviewer.<BR>I had the first edition of this book which I bought with great interest at that time. I did learn quite a few things even though I consider myself a seasoned J2EE developer. I made sure that all my development team members got a copy of this book.<BR>When I saw that the second edition was released, I was skeptical about buying it since I had the first edition. However, after browsing through the contents and reading other reviews, I decided to go for it. And it was a decision I am not regretting. The new edition is so much better in that I wish this was the first edition! The authors seem to have updated all the patterns content. A quick comparison of the patterns between both editions indicates that the content has been more or less revised completely. Almost all the text has been revised and almost all the UML diagrams seem redone to give a better understanding of the pattern. I found the first edition UML diagrams a bit lame compared to the second edition. The new edition seems to have corrected most of the discrepencies in the first edition. So if you have the first edition, dump it and get this one fast! <BR>I also found that there were 6 new patterns in the 2nd edition. The presentation tier added Context Object pattern and Application Controller pattern, Business tier added Business Object pattern and Application Service pattern. The integration tier added Webservice Broker pattern and Domain Store pattern.<BR>Having built a couple of custom persistence frameworks, I found the Domain Store interesting. <BR>One thing lacking in this edition is that the other interesting part of the book (Design considerations, Bad Practices and J2EE Refactoring) remains almost the same as in the first edition with minor exceptions. I would have liked to see the design considerations expanded. I also would have liked to have more J2EE refactorings and bad practices in the 2nd edition. Perhaps, in the next edition?<BR>Another intriguiging part of the book which I haven't gained a good understanding of yet is the Epilogue titled \\\\\"WebWorker Micro-Architecture\\\\\".<br />Overall, if you are into J2EE, just get the book no matter what.

That's opposed to know-it-all politicians and bureaucrats who make vast judgments on places they have never been and couldn't nearly understand.<br />The main problem here is that the journey was so extensive that Rogers doesn't have the space to relate an effective travelogue about all the places he visited. Entire nations are often described in a sentence or less. Meanwhile, yes/no pronouncements on the viability of investing in each location are tossed off quickly like afterthoughts. Rogers does impart some great investment advice here, like the contention that the next bull market will be in commodities (raw materials) rather than securities, most of the currencies in the world are collapsing, and that the surprise up-and-coming nations will be Angola and Bolivia. But otherwise, Rogers quickly dismisses most of the visited countries due to political strife. He also spends a lot of time on his soapbox, making vast pronouncements on how to solve the world's ills, most of which involve a simplistic belief in free trade (the phrase &quot;the miracles of international trade&quot; pops up once), and the predictable disdain for globalization's critics that we keep hearing from those with vested interests. Rogers fails to notice that much of the political strife he encountered around the world resulted from mismanaged globalization efforts.<br />Rogers should have written two books inspired by his remarkable journey. The first would be a travelogue and adventure story about the perils and rewards of death-defying travel. The second book would be a solid examination of worldwide investing opportunities and the futures of developing vs. declining nations and their economies. Both would be much stronger than this book that unsuccessfully tries to blend the two, but leaves both poorly covered.l strife he encountered around the world resulted from mismanaged globalization efforts. <br />Rogers should have written two books inspired by his remarkable journey.

In addition, telling her own life story before, during, and after the Supremes was just as good.  The untimely passing of her youngest son, told towards the end of the book, was a tear-jerker, as a feeling of empathy washed over me.  She talks about her friendship with Flo, her love-hate relationship with Diana, and her loves, including her abusive relationship with her ex-husband.  Great pictures and memorabilia (who would have thought that they had their own white bread!)!	2003-07-07

After years researching various aspects of WW2, I kept hearing tales of the Filthy 13. I met some, and ran into various A/B men associated with them. And while I can not vouch for every thing said in this book (I am not an A/B expert), most of it were extremely similar to what I had seen and read elsewhere. Keep in mind a lot of it is personal opinion, particulary the opinions about other officers and soldiers, but I quite enjoyed it. <br />Of course the real reason the Filty 13 were so great is that on D-day no less than 3 of them were ex-29th Rangers! (see 'Spearheading D-day'). <br />Anyway, I highly recommend this book as a very fun book, that portrays a quite small and unusual aspect of America's airborne troops in WW2. These are stories that are legend amoung many 101st troopers and historians. The book itself is like sitting down with Jake McNiece and listening to him tell his stories.	2003-06-17

James M. MacPherson, professor of history at Princeton, develops the case that the one-day battle in September 1862 near Sharpsburg, MD was the pivotal event of the Civil War. This is the bloodiest day of war experienced by American troops. The union commander, &quot;Little Mac&quot;, let the opportunity to shatter the Army of Northern Virginia slip away for the second time, the first being when he was just five miles from Richmond during the earlier Pennisular Campaign. It caused Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves (although only in the Confederate States). Probably kept the Republicans in control of both houses of Congress after the 1862 election. And, perhaps most importantly, decided the issue of recognition of the Confederacy for the British and French. This book is an overview of the events leading up to the battle at Antietam Creek and it focuses on the socio-political background at the time. Military history buffs who prefer to read minute details of battles and campaigns will find this book lacking. However, one cannot analyze warfare without understanding what lead up to the use of armed force. This is a concise, must read for those interested in the second most important war our nation has ever fought.	2003-05-22

But while no good dad would name his favorite child, the father of this book is happy to announce it.  This is my favorite; all of me is in here.<br />What Clients Love follows the format of  Selling the Invisible--the sections are approximately as long as that book, and 30% shorter than those in Invisible Touch.  In doing this, I was heeding my own advice: people today have  little time.  To communicate at all, you must do it quickly.  This meant days in coffee shops, slicing, dicing, and cuttting until all the fat seemed gone.<br />A peril of this--as one reader reminded me---is that some truly critical points are expressed so quickly that the hurried reader might forget to pause and absorb it.  And the second peril is that brevity can easily be interpreted as breeziness, and that lighter copy lacks weight.  But in balancing those very real risks against the reward, that risk seems worth taking.  The vehicle is better suited to my objective of not just informing, but of coaxing, persuading, prodding and pushing.  This approach and these words seem best suited to the cause : helping build businesses that make our lives better.<br />That sounds a bit grand, perhaps, but so are the objectives of these extraordinary businesses.  They aim for the heavens in one sense, and yet almost at eye-level in another; they aim at our hearts.  <br />With this forum for me for these few seconds, I do want to thank the startling number of people who have taken the time to write here and to me, with their words of thanks.  A particularly memorable note came from Columbia, South America, from a man named Carlos. His note gushed in his halthing English--you could imagine him reading very, very slowly through Selling the Invisible--and ended with words you never expect in business: \\\\\"A big hug for you!\\\\\"  <br />Perhaps that means something slightly different in Carlos' native language, but like the many kind words here on Amazon, it made me smile.  Thank you."	2003-01-08

Hayek's \\\\\"The Road to Serfdom\\\\\" on economic development when I first read that book. Fortunately, \\\\\"The Commanding Heights\\\\\" provides me with the answer - Planned economy becomes the mainstream of Western societies after World War II and the system had brought these countries economic prosperity for several decades. There was a danger that the policy makers would think the system is a \\\\\" cure-all\\\\\" medicine. Free marketers such as Margaret Thatcher and Milton Friedman had to battle under that tough environment. Hayek's work however opens up the mind of Mrs. Thatcher and provides the foundation for the Renaissance of individualism.<BR>\\\\\"The Commanding Heights\\\\\" is a book of economic history after World War II. The book covers the economic transformation of regions or countries such as U.S.A., Western Europe, Central Europe, Britain, China, India, Latin America and Southeast Asia. The background and achievement of key politicans and economists are also contained extensively. The messages of the books are clear - Free market economic system is better than planned economy and government's role should be shifted from market player to referee.<BR>While I agree that the book is highly readable, some pieces are missing, still. Readers cannot find story of developed African countries such as South Africa and Egypt. If you want to know the economic history of the Middle East, you must be prepared to be disappointed. In addition, as the book is descriptive in nature, in-depth analysis on why centrally planning suddenly turns sour is lacking. These are my reasons that the book is rated as a four-star instead of five-star publication.<BR>In all, the authors have done a tremendous job in the subject. This book should be short-listed as one of the textbooks for students studying economics or history."	2002-12-26

To really experience-rather than to just read-the depth in this book is to awaken to trust, intimacy, and spiritual growth in all the vulnerable, guarded places of your heart.  Lisa Tawn Bergren has, for our edification and with prayer and fullness, used her gifts to present us with the opportunity to lay our broken selves before our God.  But more importantly, she guides us into an intimate and open place for us to receive what God has been waiting to give.  If you have been afraid to apply your imagination to your spiritual life, you have, with your safe-guarding, perhaps unknowingly built a wall between you and God's highest good for your life. Truly, I have not read a book on prayer that so quickly and assuredly breaks down barriers, renders peace and helps us to surrender to the restorative work of the Holy Spirit.

In some ways these dreams were realized while reading this book.  I was swept into Huck's life and became a part of his adventures throughout the story. For such a young boy, Huck has many experiences that most of us will only encounter in our dreams, and this is why the book is appealing to me and people of all ages.  Everyone at one point or another in their lives has longed to go on an adventure, and this book satisfies that longing. Mark Twain is an amazing writer who is able to spur your imagination, because his choice of dialect and visuals make everything seem real. At times it was a little hard to understand what was going on when Jim (Miss Watson's slave) was talking because of his strong southern vernacular, but I know that if I was there I would have a hard time understanding what he was saying.  This book grabbed my attention from the moment I picked it up.  I read it  for the first time in eleventh grade and now as a college freshman I was required to read it again.  Unlike many books that I have had to read over the years, this book was not a chore, because I fell in love with the story all over again.  I recommend this book for people of all ages. If you're just looking for a good book to read for yourself or maybe even to a child, I definitely recommend Huck Finn.  Or, if you have to read it for school, give the book a chance, and you might just fall in love with it like I did.	2002-12-04

The book is a collection of independant essays on a variety of wars with American involvement. Although I found the book had alot of his own opinion on each battle or war I also discovered that he had some unique historical insight.  He also posed some interesting questions as to the resoning behind the very critical decisions made in each war. After reading just the Introduction I became intrigued and aware that Ambrose has an amazing grasp on his material and understanding of the complexities of war. Ambrose has a rare gift of understanding, making each essay in the book remarkably easy to follow while at the same time passing along a great wealth of knowledge.  After reading this book for the second time, I realized that if an author can make his reader think about his ideas and therories to the extent at which I was debating them within my own consciousness, then this book is well worth the time of others.	2002-11-05

Only Charity was not going along with well managed plans.  Instead, she opens a bookstore in Whispering Waters Cove.  A quaint peer, with bunch of eclectic shops and boutiques.  Only problem, the owner of the peer died and left the pier to Elias Winters, along with his odd ball shop called Charms & Virtues.  Land speculation is booming and the peer is either a thorn in the side or a place that will be developed, and everyone is betting that Elias is just waiting to make his move.<br />Only Charity, is marshalling the shop owners, trying to fight the greed mayor and their cronies, and plans to spearhead an open confrontation with Elias.  Elias claims he is not going to sell the peer, and plans on running Charms & Virtues.  She does not full trust him at first, but that does not stop her from being attracted to the controlled man.  She finds he is definitely a man where still waters run deep, a martial arts master, former career executive and a man with intense emotions that he keeps them very tightly controlled.

This single concept flies in the face of our traditional Freudian notion that our morality is our socialized id.  So radical is Downey's thinking on this subject (expressed through his fictional persona Red Rover)that The Moralist throws down the gauntlet not only to our conventional ideas of moral principle but to moral authority itself.  The Moralist is an audacious and ambitious book.  In one sweeping stroke, Downey seeks to topple the temple of all our moral assumptions.  This would be a breathtakingly presumptuous effort, if it weren't so damn funny.	2002-10-11

We both enjoy reading. She is an avid fan of novels, and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that Ms. Miller had signed it. I read the storyline, and it intrigued me. I ended up reading the book myself. Incest, drugs, and family drama, are topics that many people don't want to talk about, much less write about (some of these issues are TOO close to home for some of us). Ms. Miller handled it very well, and did a great job in holding my attention throughout. My teen-aged daughter, and my elementary school aged nieces saw me reading it in my office, looked at the cover, and said, \\\\\"Uncle D, are you reading a girl book?\\\\\" I told them \\\\\"There's no such thing as a girl or boy book, as long as it's good reading.\\\\\" I am going to pick up a copy of Ms. Miller's first book,  \\\\\"Satin Doll\\\\\", for my wife...and lock my office door."	2002-10-11

John Smiley has done an absolutely wonderful job with his LEARN TO PROGRAM WITH VISUAL BASIC 6. He assumes no prior knowledge or natural computer proficiency, and thus his explanations can be easily grasped by anyone who takes the time to read and understand them. He frequently gives examples of real-life questions by his students about practical problems and then gives a simple, direct answer. For those who are even somewhat intimidated by the idea of learning a computer language, be hesitant no more. LEARN TO PROGRAM WITH VISUAL BASIC 6 is so straightforward and effective of a teacher that you will be learning in no time at all. By the end of the book you will have learned about classes and some of the basic ideas behind object-oriented programming.<br />I do have a caveat though for those who are more experienced with computer science. This book is not for you. If you already have a solid grasp of the ideas behind computer science or already know a more complicated language such as Visual C++, look elsewhere for a self-instruction course on Visual Basic. The reason that this book is so effective for beginners is the same reason it will be somewhat frustrating and seemingly ridiculous to experienced programmers. You will read ten pages and think to yourself that it could have been explained effectively in one. <br />In summary, buy this book if you have no previous programming experience and are at all interested in learning a language. If you are a computer science major or someone who already knows some programming, look elsewhere for a more sophisticated treatment of Visual Basic.	2002-10-03

That also makes it one of the greatest betrayals ever perpetrated by an author upon his readers.  I don't know what the deal is, greed, illness, a lobotomy, but books 5 (A Method for Madness) & 6 (A Time for Treason) don't look like they will ever see daylight.

Any of us can do the math that shows that it's nearly impossible to live on the kinds of wages that so many jobs in this country pay; few of us seem to _do_ that math, though, and even if you look at the numbers it doesn't necessarily sink in what they mean, if you're living a more comfortable life.  So Barbara Ehrenreich's experiment in making a living from the kinds of jobs available to someone without a college education or a lot of work experience is valuable as a graphic and immediate illustration of how hard and unjust life is for so many Americans.<br />Ehrenreich found that, without working two jobs -- and two physically grueling and often messy and disgusting jobs at that -- she simply couldn't make a living.  And it wasn't just her -- few of her co-workers were doing any better than she was, and many were sleeping in their cars despite working full time.  In one of the most vivid accounts of how inadequate these jobs are, one of Ehrenreich's co-workers at Wal-Mart (the nation's largest employer) couldn't afford a shirt that was on clearance there, despite the fact that Wal-Mart is a discount store to begin with.  <br />Anyone who wants to talk about work, poverty, homelessness, or government policy on any of those subjects in the United States should have to read this book.  Yes, you could get the same basic facts in other books, but this one puts a lot of facts together with a compelling personal account of just how those facts affect people day to day.	2002-09-05

Perhaps he is, but he is also sensitive and aware of the effects of life's struggles on those with whom he shares the town of Empire Falls. Character development is not one of Mr. Russo's weaknesses, I thoroughly enjoyed Miles, Tick, Janine, Max, Bea and all the other folks of Empire Falls. Why you may ask, I think because it was a believable story. Having driven through many towns such as Empire Falls and wondering why anyone would stay there, this book answers the question thoroughly from various view points. A terrific read it will be in my top 10 books of the year.	2002-08-26

Schulz.  I, like millions of others, grew up with Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Violet, Snoopy, Pig Pen, Schroeder, and Sally.  Every year at Halloween I looked forward to seeing the story of sincere Linus waiting for the Great Pumpkin in the pumpkin patch. This book contains all the characters and it re-tells essentially the same story but it has been illustrated by Paige Braddock rather than Schulz and adapted by Justine and Ron Fontes and seems to have lost something in the process. The Peanuts gang always was kind of surly with each other, calling names like Blockhead, pulling footballs out from each other and laughing at one another's expense. In this story, of course, Linus is the brunt of the teasing because he has undying faith in the mythical Great Pumpkin.  For years I loved watching the Charlie Brown cartoon specials, the catchy piano jazz theme and the short, big-headed kids with their flat feet and funny facial expressions.  Who could help loving Snoopy as the Red Baron or little Woodstock? These cartoons have always had a decidedly adult sense of humor, sometimes rather dark humor even though children the world over have loved the cartoon kids themselves.<br />  This book doesn't work, in my opinion, precisely because it is NOT the TV movie.  As a picture book it is placed directly into the world of children's literature and as such, the innocence of the readership makes satire seem inappropriate and it comes off as bad-tempered, impatient and indifferent to the feelings of others.  This is not something I want to convey to children and it is not something I like to see done to a classic. Most of the pictures show facial expressions on the kids that are either discouraged, sad, taunting or angry.  There's even anguish on one little face. There are only a few smiles.<br />  It is touted as the 35th Anniversary edition but it really doesn't celebrate much of an anniversary because it is an off-shoot of the real thing...sadly not too close to the real thing, in fact.  I got this book because I had feelings of fond nostalgia for Linus and his vigil in the pumpkin patch but it made me question why I ever liked it in the first place, and that's sad.t really doesn't celebrate much of an anniversary because it is an off-shoot of the real thing...sadly not too close to the real thing, in fact.

However, this book is very disappointing; multivariable analysis sections are superficial in treatment. In particular, the authors avoid math treatment once basic statistics sections are over. I don't understand the techniques described in those multivariable analysis sections based on whatfs written in this book; I already have the understandings in some of the topics discussed in the book, so I know what I am talking about partly. Also the rest of non-statistical sections are very boring to read, and examples are in some cases not easy to relate to the material in the context directly. What makes me most bored might be authors explaining trivial things like &quot;Hospital is the place to go when you get sick....g (Analogy) Considering the quality of this book in terms of depth, this book is way overpriced. I recommend the following books instead: Business Research Methods by Zikmund (much clear presentation on methodologies), and Probability and Statistics by DeGroot (one of the best in these subjects) for non-multivariable sections, and for multivariable sections, Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis by Wichern and Johnson (for math taste), and Multivariate Data Analysis by Anderson, et al (for non-math taste). Also recommended is Data Mining Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations by Witten and Frank (for Data Mining programming).

Arthur Miller touches on so many themes and in turn touched my heart at the same time. After reading the back cover of the book, I was anticipating a shallow and predictable anti-semitism novel. I mean, how can one man's glasses a book make, right? Wrong...<br />Anyone who has ever felt alienated for any reason can empathize with Lawrence Newman, the Christian protagonist, who attempts to no end to conform to his antisemitic neighbors' absurd standards, but to no avail. His boss orders him to purchase glasses due to his myopia(irony indeed) and then his perfect world turns upside down as he himself is branded as \\\\\"looking Jewish\\\\\" by his neighbors, his boss, and even his mother. He is poked, prodded and pushed to the brink.<br />William H. Macy is perfect for the role of Newman.

Her courage and persistence in seeking justice for herself was admirable because one can only imagine how difficult this was for her.

The prices paid are astronomical when measured against the joys reaped.<br />This is an intense book, marked by a profundity that keeps the reader aware of the sadness that permeates the writing. Writing where the description of even the joyful moments, which are all too few, has an element of sadness shadowing it. At times it became quite difficult for me to read, the story telling was that antagonizing, pulling the reader along like a whirlpool of exasperation, never knowing what would surface. I can only now say that I am glad I continued because it was certainly worth the ride.  Kelsana 4/16/02	2002-04-17

The part where it's all diary page's is what did not impress me.  When it jump's from different character's so quickly in a way confused me.  You also as a reader had to figure out which character played what part in the book.  It would of been a good book if they had made it some what like a story instead of diary pages.  For those reason's I rate this book a 1.	2002-04-17

The purpose of the book is not a biblical exegesis exercise, but rather to help pastors and chaplains draw on the disciplines of spirituality and psychology to gain a deeper understanding of what patients, familiy members and hospital staff go through.  Pruyser's book is a pioneering effort in this respect, because next to Anton Boisen's work in the 1940's and 50's, this book is one of the few that adopts an interpretive rather than prescriptive approach toward pastoral care.  In a nutshell, Pruyser seems to be saying that if we are to be effective in our pastoral care, we must first have a grasp on what situation the patient and his or her family are in- what are their resources for support?  where do they locate ultimate meaning and hope?  what are their challenges?  What pastoral resources can be mobilized to address these needs?<br />Pruyser provides an extremely helpful model and template for understanding the spirutal needs of the patients to whom we minister. For those of us who make pastoral care visits, particularly in the hospital, on a regular basis- this book is tremendously helpful food for thought.  If you are looking for a book of proof texts on the basis for pastoral care, however- that is not what this book is all about.  Remember, Pruyser's approach is descriptive, rather than prescriptive.  This book is an excellent pastoral care resource for chaplains, pastors and pastoral care visitors.  I have used it in my work as a hospital chaplain and I would highly recommend it.	2002-04-01

Someone has translated the tangled World Wide Web into something even I can understand!<br />Ms. Holmes has created a book that is useful, well organized, pertinent, well written, and even pleasurable to read!  So many of the internet books on the market today -- even those allegedly designed for beginners -- are of little use to anyone <BR>but the seasoned professional.  The Internet is a tool everyone can use and Web Usability &amp; Navigation gives its readers the background they need to make the most of the Web. <br />I loved all of the examples -- I'm the type of person who learns best by seeing others' experiences.  A good story will go a lot further with me than a bunch of technical jargon and Ms. Holmes has mastered the art of telling a good story with a purpose. <br />When I started reading Web Usability &amp; Navigation, I had several <BR>preconceived ideas about what I wanted in a web page.

Tia's body slumps and withers with age as everyone around her remains young and beautiful.  Then her lover of fifty years past joins her on an underwater archeology expedition to the drowned islands of Hawaii.<br />The other members of the crew either hate or fear Tia because she is undergoing a disgusting metamorphosis that they no longer have to experience, although they can still die by accident.  Her former lover takes up with her again because he is attracted by the thing he fears the most:  death and dying.  When Tia discovers why he has made up to her, she boots him back out of her life.<br />Most of Tia's life is told in flashbacks:  before and after she discovers that the immortality treatment doesn't work for her.  Once she realizes her fate, she speeds through denial, stays angry through most of the book, bargains with her fate by learning all she can about the immortality process, goes through a deep depression when her one true love decides to take off for Pluto.  If she goes with him, she'll be the only member of the crew who will age during their long journey.  Instead she locks herself away from the rest of humanity on a solar monitoring station for a few years, almost goes mad, and finally returns to Earth in a state of semi-acceptance.<br />One thing is for sure---she isn't going to take any more crap from the Immortals.<br />Deep under the waters of the Pacific, Tia discovers a powerful process that the Immortals had lost.  If she can learn how to use it before her shipmates slaughter her, she will gain the ability to transform herself and her world.<br />\\\\\"Islands\\\\\" is an interesting psychological study as well as future science with all the trimmings."	2002-03-09

He always has a way to use Burke to reflect the parts of society that people don't know about or issues that we should be aware of while he keeps us entertained with his minimalist crime fiction page turners.   You don't want to put one of his books down once they have you looked.   This time, the issue is chronic pain managment for people with terminal illness.  That is just one of the plots as Burke is searching for a missing teenager who doesn't want to be found, and fiction crosses path with reality as Burke meets a real life comic book artist suffering from Dissociative Identity disorder (or also known as multiple personality)and uses her life for a comic book.   Vachss has a clever way of getting reality to seep into his fiction and when the book is done, you wonder what will happen to Burke next when he is back in New York City with the only family he knows.   vachss is brutal in his fiction and it is only for the ones who want to learn about the corners of society we know little about and for those who like their crime novels gritty.	2002-02-25

(But that doesn't mean it doesn't have any meaningless hype.

"Just finished all 626 pages of Gerald Nicosia's scrupulously-researched tome, Home to War.  While I at first thought that it might be dense and difficult to read, I found that I couldn't put it down.  And while I was reasonably certain that I was already familiar with the Big Picture, I discovered in Home to War a wealth of illuminating detail about how our government operates to suppress unpleasant and uncomfortable truths, as well as the people who put their very lives on the line to try to tell those truths... <br />I certainly can't swear that every statement on every page of Nicosia's book is true down to the minutest detail.  Given human fallability, I would be extremely surprised if it was.  At the same time, one does not need a PhD in American History, but only a modicum of life experience, to know how often and how predictably the American government and its \\\\\"free-market\\\\\" culture exploits its citizens' youth and strength in its service - sucking the very marrow from their bones in the process - and then hangs them out to dry, casting them on the scrapheap of discarded humanity when they become an inconvenience, a \\\\\"burden\\\\\" on society.  We are not, of course, the only country in the world to do this, but the hypocrisy of it in light of our professed national ideals makes it doubly shameful.<br />My own experience in this regard arose not as a Viet Nam or \\\\\"Operation Desert Storm\\\\\" vet but as a disabled firefighter, yet it's exactly the same phenomenon.  The importance of Nicosia's book is to make us aware of the recurring patterns of official government denial, mendacity, hypocrisy, and abandonment of its own citizens, not to \\\\\"prove\\\\\" whether or not certain dikes were bombed in a specified location in Viet Nam.   Sure, Nicosia has a point of view - in this case an empathy with the disabled veterans - but what author doesn't?  And would the book be a fraction as good if it had been written without passion?<br />In his essential purpose of writing Home to War as achronicle of the Viet Nam vets' struggle with the very government to which they gave their unstinting service and their very lives,  Nicosia succeeds exquisitely.  My recommendation:  Read Home to War, hug a veteran (even the ones who didn't like Nicosia's book), and inform yourself in as many ways as possible about the true nature of the society in which you live."	2002-01-16

The book is wonderful.  It answers kids' questions in a way that they can understand.  My daughter was 3 1/2 at the time and the book was a favorite -- it satisfied her curiosity in a more &quot;grown-up way&quot; than most other sibling stories, but without giving too much information.  I have found that many books just treat the pregnancy as a very vague and &quot;untouchable&quot; topic for kids.  This brings it home in a sensitive and caring way.<br />The questions asked (Where is the baby? How did the baby get in there? How can a baby fit inside Mommy? What makes the baby grow &amp; how can I help? How does the baby eat? Can the baby see and hear me? What does the baby do all day? Why doesn't Mommy feel well sometimes? Why does Mommy go to the doctor so much? When will the baby come out? &amp; How does it come out?) cover most aspects of pregnancy.  The &quot;How did the baby get in there?&quot; section does use correct terms (sperm and ovum) but does not get too &quot;graphic&quot; -- it explains conception as pieces of a puzzle fitting together. The book also uses terms like umbilical cord and birth canal, but in a way that is not intimidating to kids.  The book gives a good overview and makes the sibling feel connected and part of the process (each section refers to something they can do to help out or experiment to help them feel what the baby may be feeling).  I would have loved if the book had covered what happened once the baby came home -- but I see now that topic is a whole new book!  <br />I highly recommend this book!  Enjoy it with your soon-to-be big brother/sister!  It can promote a lot of discussion &amp; create some special moments together before the baby comes -- it did for us!	2001-10-18

I believe it was Hosanna's wish that her daughter, Matriece to bring back honor to the Clark family name and get payback from Gilda.	2001-09-10

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and why?  Was it just a meth snorting, ex-soldier, down-and-out, government-hating punk, or is there more to this than that?  Could the government itself be behind the attack or at least involved in some way?   If you want a serious look at these questions then this book is definitely NOT what you want to read.  <br />I found this book to be a very well written and clear reporting of the party line that Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols were solely responsible for the OKC bombing; them and no one else.  This could be, but there is significant other evidence and testimony to the contrary that the government just doesn't want to address head on and this book doesn't either.  The author does address some of this other evidence but only in the most cursory and unconvincing fashion.  For instance, an Air Force general with a background in weapons systems claimed in writing that the bomb McVeigh supposedly used could NOT have done the kind of damage inflicted on the A. P. Murrah Federal Building and that there must have been more or different bombs involved.  This stunning claim is waved off by the author with a single valueless sentence: &quot;This thesis is disputed by physicists on the grounds that the five-thousand-pound truck bomb did have the capacity to blast upward and outward, like a balloon&quot;.  What kind of &quot;evidence&quot; is that? Who are these physicists and why should they be believed?  It's things like this (and there are other examples) that make this book seem like government spin doctoring and not a serious look at who is behind the biggest single act of terrorism on U.S. soil and why it was committed. <br />The author addresses the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents in a similarly odd way.  He does say that the government botched both of those raids but he does so in the absolutely least offensive and most excusable way to downplay the government's mistakes.  He leaves out critical details, downplays significant events and gets some things completely wrong that are not disputed facts regarding these cases.  This kind of writing lacks credibility in my mind.<br />This author would have you believe that everything's just fine now that McVeigh has been caught and that you are a twit if you believe anybody but the government.  Don't fall for this and, for that matter, don't fall for every conspiracy theory you hear either.  By all means read this book but also read others like &quot;The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror&quot;, &quot;Others Unknown: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing Conspiracy&quot; and others and then THINK about what is or isn't the truth based on credible evidence. There's more to this than we're being told and the folks who died in this attack deserve better from us than to just shrug our shoulders and go back to what we were doing just because the government says it's OK now.	2001-06-28

The author suffered from manic-depression.  And he shows all of us how to cure our depression. There are twelve Golden Keys.  Twelve chapters to cover all aspects of a good treatment plan for depression.  The author has been there.  He has been what he calls a &quot;vegetable.&quot; One who stays indoors and does nothing but watch TV.  Not cleaning.  Afraid to go outside the front door.  Almost like a vampire afraid of the light and other people.  Major<br />depression is a nightmare for so many of us.  Doing fifteen minutes of cognitive therapy will simply will not do it.  Indulging in talk therapy simply will not do it.  Going to church once a week will simply not do it.  One needs a tank. A bazooka.  A machine gun.  One needs a multi-dimensional approach.  And this is what this book does.  Let's begin. Mind you, this is my interpretation of the 12 Golden Keys. First, find a Higher Power and stick to it.  Equivocating about this or that path during your recovery will only make your depression worse.  Simply because you are not dealing with the problem of depression.  Pick a Higher Power and stick to it until you recover.  Second, do a personal health inventory.  This is included in the book. Third, you will need to decide if hospitaliztion is necessary for you.  This is very important and may save your life. The guidelines are given in the book.  Fourth, get a support team.  Like the Godfather, surround yourself with people who can help you.  Fifth, keep your emotions intact during your recovery.  Your recovery must have first priority.  Don't get a divorce or join the Navy. Diet and Nutrition are sixth.  Drink lots of water.  At least 20% of your diet should be whole uncooked food. What we eat does affect our minds. Seventh, meditation and journal writing are healing.  Do them and start small. The same with exercise.  The author tells you how to start.  Eighth, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!  Preferably for one hour a day.  This is the real killer.  Hibernation.  This is death.  Get out or get dead.  Number nine involves planning a schedule.  This does so much for depression.  He tells you how.  Tenth, go to support groups.  The author provides his own suggestion of an ideal group format.  But the main thing is to share your depression with others.  Eleven, find a positive meaning for your depression.  And plug this into your conception of a Higher Power.  Twelve, stay where you are.  No big gulps. One day at a time.  This book is simply a wonderful gem for all mental health professionals.  And for all those who suffer from depression.  I have studied each chapter and I am applying the concepts and methods to my life.  And I am sorry to the author for any errors that I might have made in this review.  Buy the book and get well.  Just one day at a time.  That's the most anybody can do.  Thank you.al killer.  Hibernation.  This is death.  Get out or get dead.  Number nine involves planning a schedule.

A lawyer, one day, has some clintonian activity in his car with his wife while driving. he hits a jaywalking old gipsy woman and kills her. The police chief will excuse the driver. The judge will acquit him. But the father of the old lady will curse them three. And then it is a fight between the lawyer and the old gipsy man, a fight to death. The maffia will be brought into the picture and they will victimize the gipsies all along the Atlantic coast of New England. Finally the old gipsy man will take his curse back but in such a way that the lawyer will have to pass it to someone else, and he chooses his wife. But unluckily his daughter will be caught in the trap too and the lawyer will take the curse onto him again but with no possible return on the passing it on to other people. There is thus no escape, no future. The curse has to run its course to the end. This book is both suspense and total absolute fate. No way out of it. The simple reason why it is so fatalistic is because there is no light in man, just the dark side, dominant and all-invading. No fight between light and night, but only between night and night, between two darker shades of darkness. A thriller that has the taste of a moral tale about the deepest nature of man. But a moral that brings no salvation....	2001-06-10

I generally admire Richard Friedman's work, but I don't think he has performed a useful service in publishing this volume. His translation is interesting, but the Hebrew font is difficult to read. Furthermore, his comments on the text can be found in other volumes. The a big lack is the omission of Haftarot. Finally, for my specific needs, I found that teenagers could not relate to either the translation or the commentary.

This book covers many very important areas of Delphi programming. Book starts with Main Window class, variables, arrays, etc., covering many Pascal basics, etc, then it covers some API, Messaging basics, DLLs and COM basics (extremely boring examples) on less the 100 pages, the ActiveX on les than only 70 pages, Database development basics again, very basics of Internet programming, and many other like this.<br />I have to admit that book is written *nicely* and has attractive and easy explanations, which makes the reader understand everything. I wanted to point out that this book is excellent for a beginner who wants to know wide range of elementary of Delphi. It leaves you an impression that you are good and that you know the stuff now. Which is partially a true - you will perhaps understand all that is written  - but that's not all, there is much more behind that.<br />Therefore don't expect that you will find the real stuff, real tricks, and solutions to real problems. This is *not* a book that you'll need while working on a real project! - If you know all basics then you don't need this book - except you have forgotten some of them.<br />I was developing some COMs, DLLs, and this book didn't help me at all. I also was reading articles in various Delphi magazines, some of them written by Steve, and there is always the same issue: all examples are just superficial (give you only a scheme how to construct the code). Everything works if you just copy an example, but the author leaves you at that point. No further explanations, no details on why is solution like that. If you go on developing, you will find yourself asking numerous questions: how to do this and that, why this crashes, why I got null in this callback, and many other serious questions. This is why I said that this is only a *basics* book. It leaves you an impression that you understood everything mentioned in chapter and that you know the stuff now - but you don't.<br />Finally, 4 stars is for the certainly the *best* book that nicely introduces huge capabilities of Delphi (I have read many other books: Mastering Delphi, Unleashed, and similar books that cover all Delphi). *But*, if I had to rate how this book is useful for real life programming problems it would be *1 star* only. You will need to buy some other book for COM, WEB programming, etc., because, one more time, examples are too simple.<br />Author leaves the web site and email to ask or to send comment about the book, but don't bother - Steve doesn't read that. At least the site seems to have some code fixes.<br />I have seen other versions of this book for Delphi 5 and 6, some of things were fixed, but it is still written in the same manner.	2001-05-25

Why on earth would me need another Messiah if Jesus had done the job?  I don't know anything about Fatima, but I quickly wearied of the whole female Godhead theme in this book.  Apparently, Jesus wasn't good enough, and Mary was the real God, thus the need for *another* female messiah in the year 2000.  I don't have some macho pride because Jesus was male, that's just the way it was.  I had nothing to do with God's choice of gender for the Messiah, nor did anybody else, so what's the big deal?  Anyway, this book at times seemed blasphemous and mixed religious imagery in with distasteful descriptions of sexual violence.  Of, of course, there's the typical portrayal of priests being vile, lewd, cruel, or at least carnal and suffering no consequences, keeping their jobs.  What's with this talk about a priest going to hell for simply being involved in battling the Devil?  Last time I checked, fighting against evil or sin didn't cause you to go to hell.  The female lead in this book was typically wooden, and the plot twist making her the real virgin was absurd.  Also, what's with the reviewers here who write a book report style summary before providing their comments?  Finally, what's with the 1-2 page chapters?  That seems like a cheap way to drive up the price of a hardcover.  Speaking of which, I threw my hardcover copy in the trash at the airport, becasue I didn't want anybody else subject to the twisted ideals in the story.	2001-03-11

Now that the children are grown and moved away, husband Cecil has left her in search of lost youth.  Her only son Lewis  is the family scapegoat, always in trouble, not living up to his potential.  Paris, the first-born is trying to be the perfect one, while Janelle is trying to devine her place in the world, and Charlotte is just plain mad for being overlooked all these years. As it has been all her mothering life, Viola knows that she doesn't have enough time or energy or money, and heavens knows she can't make her children's lives better.  If anything, Viola's plainspokeness has made it even harder for her to reach her children.  Each family member is struggling to cope with their own life, and their worries about their mother and her asthma.  It is an acute asthma attack that first brings this family back together, and sets in motion the events that shake them out of their comfort zones.  Terry McMillan has written an energetic tale of family life.  It is a compelling read, very character driven and each character has a distinct voice.  It is a tale of the bonds that tie families together and the love that can't fix everything, but can make a life worth living.	2001-02-11

This chain has a habit of using breed -related information in the first few chapters, then switching over to a generic, all-breed dog care information manual for the rest of the book. This doesn't mean that it is not a good book, but I prefer to read more specific information about the breed the book supposedly is about.  One thing that I liked about this book were its colorful pictures, but I would recommend that the reader spend his or her money on a more exclusively &quot;Poodle&quot; book.	2001-01-06

Left behind is the most brilliant work of literature that I have come across in my lifetime.  The author of the series, Jerry B. Jenkins, teamed up with Tim Lahaye to create a novel based on the single greatest period of history that the world shall ever experience. Jerry B. Jenkins starts the book just before the rapture, and introduces the reading audience to several characters who live in America when the rapture occurs.  The book continues by illustrating the horrific effects that result from Jesus taking his believers with Him back to heaven.  The world is in complete chaos when cars are left empty and run wild.  Planes go crashing to the earth when pilots and crews are taken, leaving only their clothes behind.  The main characters are instantly thrown into a whirlpool of confusion.  With their families gone, they have no one to turn to for answers and no way to get their lives back.  In this time of crisis, they look toward God and quickly realize what had happened to so many of their friends and loved ones.  Jesus Christ had raptured his church, and they had been left behind.  Together, these characters build their relationships with Christ and begin to share with others what they discovered.  However the world they live in is an unbelieving one, and their faith takes them for the adventure of their lives.<br />    Tim Lahaye has an amazing understanding of the tribulation period, and he shares it with us through a fictional novel mixed in with biblical truth.  I have learned so much about my own relationship with God as well as the Book of Revelations.  It has helped me to understand what is soon to come and prepare for it.  After reading this book there will be no doubt in your mind that the rapture is in all of our futures.  The way Jerry B. Jenkins uses fictional characters to show us the truth is ingenious and very effective.  The characters are developed with remarkable detail, and Mr. Jenkins illustrates the turmoil that the world is going to experience with such precision; you can see it taking place in your mind.  This book has already saved so many people from being left behind, and it has only begun.  If you are a non-believer, this book is a perfect way to start a relationship with Christ, and see your true purpose in this life.  It will show you how to accept Jesus as your savior, and it will help you envision what God has planed for us in the future.  If you already have begun your relationship with Christ, this book will take your spiritual journey to a whole new level.  No matter who you are this book will reveal to you God's awesome power in a way that only the Book of Revelations has shown us before.  This publication will definitely impact your life.  And for many of us, it will impact our afterlife as well.  Do not read this novel simply for entertainment purposes.  The tribulation period is very real, and if you think Tim Lahaye's warning to accept Christ is part of the fiction in this novel, you too will be left behind.	2001-01-04

This book was an excellent read about the Basques, their history, culture, and cuisine. The reviews have centred on Kurlansky's view of ETA. What about the rest of the book? Whales, cod, Elkano, Loyola, Arana, Aguirre, pelota, elvers .... It is amazing to find out the a Basque was the first to circumnavigate the globe, that two Basques founded the Jesuits, that Simon Bolivar was descended from Basques, and so on. Silhouette is a Basque word. Canadians will remember a great football plyer named Sam Etcheverry. Was he, too, as Basque as his name suggests?<br />I did not think this was a book about ETA. But from the reviews on this page, one would think this was a great big book glorifying terrorism! I have read this book twice. I would suggest you read it too. For once we have the chance to read about a people from their own point of view.<br />And for those who think there is too much politics in Kurlansky, forget it, life is politics! I will give you some politics for free. Like the Welsh , the Basques have been obliterated from the map for several hundred years. But entities such as &quot;Spain&quot; have only been in existence for a couple of hundred years, while the Basques trace their origins to prehistory. Spain seem to have given up all their colonies except those closest to home. The Spanish did quite a bit to keep this lucrative colony, including using the Luftwaffe to flatten Basque market towns. (Incredible now that they will not allow Picasso's Gernika to be shown in Bilbao.)Trying to kill off the Basque language,a unique tongue unrelated to any known language, was just an immense disservice to humanity.<br />The Basques (and Welsh,) however,  will be there long after Spain and Britain and other empires have ceased to be. Within the European union, there is no longer a need to keep these small nations in subjection and to deny them their rightful place. <br />Again, I say, ignore the above reviews, read this book, and decide for yourself.	2001-01-04

In this collection of short stories he decided to be a bit more conventional, and confine his 10 stories to only 10 chapters. It is here the similarity stops, for while this Author is not the only writer to have published shorter versions of their written thoughts, just like his novels they are special, unique, and share place with only a few peers.<br />The commonality here is not as apparent as in his \\\\\"History Of The World\\\\\", or other collections that carry a continuous thread. There is the consistency of the experiences of the English and the French, and the events they share, memorialize, desecrate, and impose upon one another. The most interesting manner by which these stories are linked is literally explained in the final sentence. It is not a clumsy device, but a bit of insight typical of Mr. Barnes.<br />While a given story may not encompass a great swath of time, when taken as an assemblage the reader tours the Centuries ranging from the 17th to the 21st. And while not heavy handed, he manages to bring together the farthest stretches of time in his stories to common points. They are often subtle, other times less so, but always inventive. Two aspects I enjoyed were the use of \\\\\"The Dragons\\\\\", and the part wine played in this writing.<br />Many of the stories are lighter, highlighting relationships, shared positive experience, and success. Mr. Barnes brings balance to this anthology by also exposing the darker sides of man's history, as well as his attributes. We watch Religious fervor visited with a cruelness that is painfully unique to the religiously persecuted, one person's vision of a time when sacrifice will not longer be remembered much less honored, and the events that the future does unfold.<br />Memories play a variety of roles even when uttered by the same individual. The reader can decide if the recalled thoughts are revisionary, romanticized, or outright fabrication. But whichever category you choose you will be greatly entertained.whichever category you choose you will be greatly entertained."	2000-12-18

The writing pulls you in with it's verbosity. The scenes shift the reader from the future and to the past with a minimal amout of segue-sickness.

As Crouch notes in the introduction, Haydon conceived Military Ballooning During the Early Civil War as a two volume work and there are occasional parenthetical/footnote references to engagements that were to be covered in that volume.<br />That being said, the book is fascinating, even if it only covers through 1862. Starting with a brief history of ballooning and its adoption by various military leaders during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, Hayden outlines the skepticism of U.S. generals during the Seminole Wars and the Mexican War and how they delayed the adoption of military balloons. Moving into the bulk of the book, Hayden builds on these earlier hesitancies to show how slow Union generals were to form a balloon corps and the difficulties Lowe, LaMountain and others faced in getting the army understand the value and difficulties of using balloons on the battlefield.<br />A great joy in the book are the extensive footnotes. Only a handful of pages lack them and Haydon uses the notes to provide additional information, context, and recollections, as well as sources. Haydon's love of detail is not constrained to the notes, however; he gives exacting details about the cost, materials, and staffing of the balloon corps, based upon archival records and receipts. It is a wonderful look at a little-known aspect of the Civil War and a good study of how reluctant military leaders could be to adopt/understand new technologies.	2000-09-26

He is described  as physically beautiful but it's his quiet, simple, straightforward way of  speaking and acting that will SLOW. YOU. DOWN. I don't know how to describe  the scenes he was in - they were relaxing but exciting. Lazy but sexy. He's  so enjoyable: he steals the show. That's not a bad thing. His  bride/wife/heroine Christiana (isn't that a beautiful name?) plays a big  part,of course. The romance is about both of them but it is clearly David's  book. Even though the book had that lazy charm, it moved along quickly. I  read it in a day and a half. The inside cover art is very true to the novel  - dark, handsome David with his &quot;Snow White&quot; beautiful  Christiana. All in all, a 5 star PLUS book. Very, very highly recommended.	2000-09-05

Fact is: John lived at least in the times of Tiberius, given that he was  in Jesus ministry as apostle during that time. Thus even if you exclude  Augustus, you still have 30 years off and 4 or 5 emperors off from Dom. as  alleged sixth king. Using Tiberius as first king, assuming even though  untenably that Augustus died before John was born, you have Tiberius,  Caligula, Claudius, Nero. And then several emperors in between who lasted  about a year each, then Vespasian, then Titus, then Domitian. In any event,  Domitian is NOT even close to being sixth emperor, even with the words only  six emperors lived up to time of John if one is to assume that John lived  up to 95 AD and Revelation was written that year and not 60 AD, as the  likes of RC Sproul, Steve Schlissel, Gary DeMar, Kenneth Gentry, and Keith  Mathison ably pointed out as preterists, and you also have nonpreterists  like Strong and FF Bruce and others saying so as well! So, the third grade  reading comprehension attack was both unwarranted and shows that the reader  still does not know Roman history and can only rely on insults instead of  reading what the truth of history is.	2000-08-29

Ten evangelical scholars come togher to refute the naturalistic  assumptions of the Jesus Seminar, as well as provide positive evidence for  the traditional, orthodox belief in Jesus.<br />In the introduction, Moreland  and Wilkins ask:    Can we know anything about Jesus?;   Are the biblical  records of Jesus' activities accurate?;   Is the supernatural possible in  ancient and modern times?   If the answer to these questions is 'yes', then  believing that Jesus is Messiah becomes reasonable.   Determining the  answers to these questions requires the proper use of historiography and  logical reasoning,  not a vague 'faith' that has no basis in reality (after  all, if Jesus never existed, believing that he did is simply idiotic).    Throughout the book, the contributors emphasize the importance of truth and  reason for religious belief.<br />In ch.1, Craig Blomberg begins by examining  the methodology of the Jesus Seminar and finds it lacking.  He then  provides evidence to support the historical reliability of the gospel  accounts.    In Ch.2,  Scot McKnight takes a look at the history of Jesus  scholarship and the varying descriptions that have been offered (Jesus as  Sage or Social Revolutionary).  He goes on to sketch a view of Jesus based  on broad scholarly consensus.<br />In ch.3,  Darrell Bock looks at the words  of Jesus.  Are the words ascribed to Jesus exact quotes(ipissima verba)?   Or are they 'his very voice'(ipissima vox)?   He draws a distinction  between having the precise words of Jesus and having his voice (the intent  and meaning) in an accurate summary.   In Ch. 4,  Craig Evans presents a  case for the authenticity of the deeds of Jesus as recorded in the gospels.    In Ch.5, Gary Habermas' focus is on whether Jesus performed miracles.  In  his defense of those miracles, he considers the influence of one's  worldview.  The Jesus Seminar holds a naturalistic worldview where miracles  are anathema.  He then shows that the historical evidence itself vouches  for the authenticity of Jesus' miracles.<br />In Ch.6, William L. Craig  tackles the big question:   Did Jesus rise from the dead?   He provides  three lines of evidence - 1) the empty tomb, 2) the postmortem appearances  of Jesus, and 3) the origin of the disciples' belief in Jesus'  resurrection.    He then gives a slew of evidence supporting each of the  three.   He concludes that the combined evidence meets the criteria that  historians consider in testing a historical hypothesis.    In Ch.7, Douglas  Geivett addresses the question of Jesus in light of our pluralistic  society.  He appeals to the importance of careful, rational assessment of a   religious truth claim regardless of how that religious truth claim makes  you feel.   In Ch.8, Edwin Yamauchi looks at the evidence of Jesus in  extra-biblical sources, highlighting their usefulness as well as their  limitations. <br />The text is easy to understand.   It contains plenty of  scholarly content but doesn't assume that erudition is the sole criteria  for understanding the arguments in the book.   If you're the type of reader  who enjoys flipping to the back to read the chapter's endnotes, you'll love  this book (I'd estimate that almost a fifth of Craig's chapter is written  in his endnotes).   If a skeptic/agnostic friend were to ask me why I  believe in Jesus, I'd give her this book.   If a Christian friend were to  ask me if there were any good books to help bolster her faith, I'd give her  this book.   <br />(In case you missed the point,  buy this book! )	2000-08-23

In this book he teaches and explains with the same passion and skill, sensitivity and  sensibility with which he appears to treat his patients. The result is that  this book is difficult to put down until the last page and even then, the  elegantly espoused ideas sit with you. You leave with a new appreciation  for the beauty and function of the human brain and a new compassion for the  owners of these organs. The attention paid to the evolutionary  accomplishments of women is well reasoned, understandable, and likely to be  the new paradigm for our understanding of what it means to be human. Not a  hunter, or a tool-builder, but a human. The distinction is delicate but  important. Dr. Klawans' death is certainly a loss for a number of fields  and would be even sadder if we did not have his excellent books to remember  him by. This one is very personal and reads like a letter from your family  doctor in places, never condescending, never failing to attribute and  praise the various people who played their parts in the ideas within, but  it still hits with the force of a powerful intuition and diagnostic skill.  It would have to be an exceptional legacy for anybody...	2000-08-01

I would be very curious to  know, how in this day and age of anti-child abuse literature and people  being better informed of the alternative forms of discipline available to  parents, how did this book ever get published with such a blatant display  of child abuse.

There should have been more of Lestat having fun, instead of being over-dramatic and whining, like  most of Anne's characters do most of the time. The book could have been  better because it was quite a bit over-blown, which made it very boring at  many points. The book isn't really realistic and many sequences in the  book, though inspiring and gripping sound ridiculous, like the entire story  of the twins. The Vampire Chronicles in this book get to a point of  ridiculousness and dis-belief, where the vampires have no more mystery and  darkness to them, instead they are just a bunch of whinners who get on your  nerve. The climax of the book was quite anti climactic, because there were  no surprises and no final battle. Instead the FINAL SHOWDOWN was all the  vampires talking. Talking? Give me a break. What do you expect from a book  writen by an old woman. It's still a good book but it could have been more  enjoyable and more entertaining.

Thomas and Fia, have a past, present, but will they have a  future?  <br />Fia is a tormented heroine; she's very much like Ash.  Because  of her father, she doesn't feel deserving of good things.

Send me to  Vietnam?' <br />Stoddard arrived in 'the 'Nam' in 1968, a 22-year-old career  soldier in his first war role. <br />Thirty years later he was impelled to  write this book after his young son asked him what the war was really like.  <br />Stoddard took on a difficult task - how can you relate the fear, the  courage, the comradeship, the desperate times, the deaths in mere words?  <br />But Stoddard completes his task admirably. <br />What's so refreshing about  'What are they going to do? Send me to Vietnam?' is the fact it makes no  judgements. There's no political wrangling, no debate over the rights and  wrongs of the war. <br />This is a soldier's tale - straight from the horse's  mouth. <br />Written in a pleasant and easy style, this book takes us through  Stoddard's life in the 'Nam. <br />From his first day as a tanker when he was  attacked by vicious jungle vines, to his life as a special combat soldier -  entering dangerous areas to 'sniff out' the enemy. <br />He talks about his  own personal battles - from the humorous incident when he suffers from  haemorrhoids to the heart-wrenching descriptions of the death of close  friends. <br />He chats about his fellow soldiers - and the camaraderie and  genuine love that built up around them in the most inhospitable of  conditions. <br />And he talks of the effect the war had on his life. How  thirty years later he was drawn to the grave of dead friend, how he talked  to the families of soldiers who were killed in combat, and how he misses  the friendships and purpose a war situation brings. <br />It seems wrong to  call this an entertaining book - but it is. <br />At times it's hard to  believe what you are reading is fact, not fiction. <br />I also found it a  hard book to put down. It's more acollection of stories than a formulated  record but even so, Stoddard possesses a rare gift, in that he draws the  reader in and won't let them go. <br />It's obvious he wrote this book as a  kind of 'letting go' of his own memories - a burial of the past - but this  is not a criticism, it merely makes the book even more readable.	2000-07-12

Former TV star and still sex god Zack Hunter, divorcee Charlie Plato, Angel Cervantes, and Savanna Bristow own the popular  establishment. For a change there is no body in the flowerbed or Zack's  car, leaving the four partners concentrating on ways to increase profits  such as renting Chaps for a night to various groups.<br /><br />Savanna persuades  her former high school classmates to hold their reunion at Chaps. On the  night of the party, Charlie and cohorts meet revered teacher Reina Diaz,  who many students feel saved their lives. During a break, Charlie goes to  the ladies room where she finds a dead Reina, whose neck has been broken.  Charlie begins to investigate the murder. Her actions place the four  partners and their establishment at risk from a killer who prefers to  remain anonymous.<br /><br />The Charlie Plato mysteries are progressing at a  nice rate, especially the growing attraction between Charlie and a celibate  Zack. DYING TO SEE YOU is a great mystery as well as an insightful  relationship drama that will widen marvelous Margaret Chittenden,s fan base  to the latter sub-genre. The who-done-it is cleverly constructed and  difficult to solve because the villain acts like one of the heroes.

Alan Bullock's Hitler: A Study Of Tyranny was, at the time of its release (let's cast all the way back into the 50's for that) quite imposing in its  achievement: a lengthy, scholarly tome appraising Hitler, and for awhile  the best Hitler biography out there (though I personally hold Konrad  Heiden's 1944 (! ) The Fuhrer in high esteem, as do almost all modern  Hitler biographers, who pay tribute to his impressive  perceptiveness).<br />Now, however, this work has dated very badly, especially  in its remarkably unsatisfactory portrait of the psychology of Hitler  himself.  To say, as Bullock does in this history, that Hitler was  basically without an ideology is to make a mockery of his disturbing  weltanschauung and to commit an enormous gaffe in apprehending his basic  character.  That's one of the most noticeable issues, but there are many  lesser ones involving sourcing issues, mixed-up chronologies, and a simple  lack of information (at this point, the Nazi archives were only just being  sifted through).<br />I don't mean to impugn Bullock as a historian or a  writer - his prose is perhaps less engaging that Joachim Fest's masterful  style, but certainly never parochial or pedantic, and his historical errors  and misjudgments are to be blamed more on a lack of information at the time  than any laziness on his part - but this is NOT the place to go for a  Hitler biography.  Instead, go to Joachim Fest's Hitler (written in 1972,  but still perhaps the single best long-form study of Hitler available,  despite a lack of focus on the Holocaust), or Ian Kershaw's new series of  works, the second of which should be due sometime soon.  Bullock himself  improved his Hitler biography immensely with his 1996 Hitler &amp; Stalin,  a work which sets the two leaders in parallel with each other to good  effect.  I'd recommend that one above this anyday, as it effectively  represents a revision of his original views.	2000-04-27

It was released the same week I took the MOC Accelerated Training for Windows 2000 and when my  Instructor made fun of the idea of buying such a large set of books I  calculated that I could read through the 7 volumes in 4 months if I read 50  pages daily.  After finishing the Deployment Planning Guide I'm about a  week ahead of schedule.  <br />The Deployment Planning Guide reflects  Microsoft's understanding that Windows 2000 must be implemented with  thorough planning to achieve the potential it has for supporting an  enterprise environment.  This volume is a Project Manager's dream.  Nearly  every planning base has been covered here from identifying the appropriate  composition of various teams to task sequencing to checklist templates.   The material is so well organized for guiding an implementation project  that I am surprised it was not released with a Microsoft Project file and  instructions to just add your own dates and stir.<br />The Deployment Planning  Guide provides a useful survey of many of the features of Windows 2000.   Even after a week of MOC training and reading through the two volumes  associated with that class I learned some new things from the Planning  Guide about how Win2K works.  For people who need to gain an understanding  of what the options are and how all the pieces fit together this is an  excellent read.<br />For the most part the Planning Guide is clearly and  accurately written.  A few times terms seemed to be misapplied and the  results were confusing.  Repetition became annoying as the reader was  referred to Server Help or the Unattend.doc on the installation CD for more  information too frequently.  Chapters 13 and 25 repeat the same material,  once to describe automating server installations and then again to describe  automating client installations.  These problems reflect an obvious effort  to makeeach section self contained but even so the volume is quite  readable as an overview of Windows 2000 networking.<br />Check back in about  30 days for my review of the 1500 page Distributed Systems Guide!	2000-03-13

I am quite astonished that no one has commented on the importance of Dr. Lerner's book. I propose that it be read in tandem with any other book that shows the treatment of women. Books ranging from &quot;The Red Tent&quot;  by Anita Diamant,which takes place in the Biblical era all the way to Anna  Quindlan's &quot;Black and Blue,&quot; which relates to an abused wife  today, begin to have even more signficance when one becomes familiar with  Lerner's thesis: women have suffered from a patriarchal society since time  began, and by understanding our history, we should begin to realize the  power and influence that HALF the population of the world could wield.  Lerner's book is surely academic, but it is worth reading. Imagine if ALL  women really determined we should strive for peace, equality, freedom, etc.  Lerner is a cautious optimist about the future, sensing that the women's  movement does suggest a new paradigm for the future. I read Lerner's book  two years ago and I find it relates to nearly every book I have read,  fiction and non-fiction, since.	2000-01-25

Here is the conclusion of a paper I wrote, entitled &quot;Theme and Symbolism in Crime and Punishment&quot;. It conveys how I feel about this amazing book.    Symbolism and imagery in Crime and Punishment are  used to a well-executed and imaginitive extent. Dostoevksy is able to do  with words what Picasso did with a brush. Through a couple of different  means Dostoevsky is able to convey a powerful theme, and draw the reader  into the story. Dostoevsky's means of communicating the theme of  &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; add depth to the story,a nd help make his  point against rationalists stronger. As Gibian states, &quot;Dostoevsky did  not rely solely on the weapons of his opponenet, but used the whole gamut  of his artistic resources, among which oblique reference and symbolic  devices played an important part&quot; (543). Dostoevsky's masterful use of  language and symbolism add potency and effectiveness to this timeless  tale.&quot;    In short, this book is one of the best books I have  ever read (and I've read a LOT of books in my day!)	1999-12-17

A stroll down memory lane for a jersey boy	This book was absolutely fantastic. I was 10 years old when Palisades park closed. I had vague reminiscences tucked away in the recesses of my mind of the many times I'd visited the park with my parents and grandparents. This book jogged them all loose in a wonderful cascade of memories.    The book  was cleverly written and well organized into the various epochs in the  parks history. There were many interesting facts given, of which I was  previously unaware. The book had a generous assortment of vintage  photographs. My only wish (and this is no criticism of the book or author)  was that the older pictures could have had better clarity, as I found  myself desperately trying to get into the &quot;way-back machine.&quot;  Understandably, these were old, vintage photos and some graniness was  therefore unavoidable. But I found myself clinging to each photo as  memories would unfold. There was a nice set of color photos also included  which were very vivid. I wish there could have been even more.        My  overall impression is that anyone who was ever lucky enough to have passed  through the gates of this great american park will cherish this book.It was worth 100 times the amount I purchased it. I  bought another copy for my mother. This is a book that anyone would love.  Mr. Gargiulo; Thank you so much!	1999-12-07

You play a Government Agent trying to stop a super virus from being exposed to the world.  You will venture from the subways of D.C., a  Cathedral in Kazakstan, a Muesem, and a Terrorist Base. The level design is  well thought out, and the graphics are great.  Control is just right, and  the soundtrack has some techno-spy music on it. Some missions will require  you to blast your way through a compound, others will require you to follow  a person undetected. This balance helps to remind a James Bond fan why  he/she likes Bond so much.  I would even go so far as to say this game is  more about Espionage than even Metal Gear Solid. I found myself sneaking  around more in Syphon Filter than in that other classic game. Overall, just  go out and buy Syphon Filter now, and be prepared to have a lot of free  time in order to beat this challenging masterpeice.	1999-11-28

If there were ever a garden author you would expect to find holding forth over a beer at a  neighborhood bar, daring anyone to start an argument with him, it would be  Henry Mitchell.  A man of strong opinions on almost everything to do with  gardening and life in general, his commentary is always trenchant and  pithy. <br />Although it is still an excellent read, this collection does not  reach the heights of the first two from the same author.  Mitchell's first  collection (`The Essential Earthman') was long out of print but is now  available again.  His second collection (`One Man's Garden') is also  available.   I'd recommend anyone not familiar with Mitchell's writing to  read one of those before diving into this book, but only because they are  so good, not because this one is bad. <br />As with his other books, there is  a lot of practical advice crammed into these pages, especially for city  gardeners. Non-city dwellers may sometimes find the urbanocentric view  disconcerting, but never uninteresting.   <br />If you are looking for a  \\\\\"how-to\\\\\" book or a step-by-step guide, this isn't it.

For  heaven's sake, don't get some edition that has been &quot;finished&quot; by  someone else. What we have here is the dark work of a mature stylist, who  still has the gifts of comedy and character.

IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE<br />Is it ethical to deceive participants in an  experimental situation? If the answer to that is yes, is it still ethical  to keep the real meaning of the experiment from the individual? That is, is  it necessary to conduct a debriefing session when the experiment is over?  If the subject is made to feel uncomfortable because of his behavior during  the session, is that still ethical?  Suppose the person is so devastated by  the experience that he carries the altered image of himself for much of the  rest of his life and finds it difficult to deal with the guilt. In a study  by Milgram, a confident business man was told to administer what he  believed was a possibly lethal shock to a confederate of the experimenter.  Milgram describes his behavior. &quot;Within 20 minutes he was reduced to a  twitching suttering wreck who was rapidly approaching a point of nevous  collapse.&quot;  Is this still acceptable, all in the &quot;Name of  Science?&quot;<br />I do not know the answers to these questions, but I have a  much better understanding of the entire problem of of deception in  experimental psychology after reading James Korn's Excellent book  &quot;Illusions of Reality&quot;.<br />Korn has done a masterful and  monumental task of presenting the evidence on which a decision on the  ethics of deception can be made.  His approach is well balanced and  thorough.  All deception is not unethical. &quot;Social psychologist  justify their use of deception partly in terms of benefits to society that  will result from the research. &quot;One of these benefits is that we now  have a better understanding of human nature because of research in social  psychology.&quot;<br />Psychologists and any one else who intends to do  experimental work with human should read this book.	1998-08-23

The test was amazingly accurate 100% of the times I used it and observed it being used. Dr. Luscher was a Swiss Psychiatrist who spent much of his life developing this deep psychological test. While it has never had wide acceptance in America, his work was widely accepted in Europe. In fact, a Volkswagon plant was painted for the desired effects on workers after consulting with Dr. Luscher. In the introduction of his book, he carefully states that the test is very easy to administer but it is a deep psychological test is not a parlor game, and should be used very responsibly. As a professional in the field of Clinical Psychology, I have used this test as a diagnostic tool for many years, although it took me eleven years to find it as it was only available in the Medical Library at New York University, and not available to the public. As de! ep as the test results are, it is incumbant on the test adminstrator to use the information diagnostically and judiciously for the benefit of the patient. If it can be located (and I will not volunteer my copies), it is only meant for the serious, responsible, ethical practioner who will find it to be one of the best diagnositic tools for any age group. Dr. Luscher also wrote two other books which help understand a person by the color choices in their environments. They are also very revealing..and I am not volunteering my copies of these either. Anyone interested should turn up every rock until they can locate Dr. Luscher's wonderful books.	1998-08-02

The usual reading of this phrase is that people should all have an equal chance to succeed - what each person makes of that chance is delimited by his/her own gifts and abilities. Right now, there is an alarming trend to make sure all people are equal in the literal sense - often people who are not qualified to do something are pushed up based on some bogus criterion (race, gender, you name it) and people who are qualified despite not having any extra help are pushed down. In &quot;Anthem&quot;, Ayn Rand follows this trend to its logical conclusion. The average has become the enforced norm and people with any talents whatsoever are shoved to the bottom of society, lest they accomplish something. It is no wonder Equality 7-2521 and International 4-8818 are friends (something forbidden in and of itself as an expression of individual choice) - they are both talented in one area or another and, though they do not say it out loud, they feel that they have more in common with each other than with all their &quot;brothers&quot;.

I've had this lens for 2 months and finally got decided to try it out today. I don’t use 500+ lenses often, but it’s good to have one when you need it.<br /><br />1st. When you get into telephoto lenses, a good tripod becomes mandatory.  Don’t use this lens with a lightweight tripod.This lens requires a good solid tripod.<br /><br />2nd. Because it is an F/8 lens, it needs a lot of light.<br /><br />I’m uploading 3 images taken with my Pentax K30 using an automatic shutter speed. The two photos of the butterfly are the same photo with one of them cropped much tighter. The butterfly was about 70 feet away. The camera was set at 200 ISO, which is my normal ISO setting. It was mounted to my car's driver-side window. As you see, there could be several reasons beyond the lens for why the image is soft, including the fact that this is a manual focus lens and my eyes are getting old.<br /><br />The image of the flowers was shot from about 20 feet away with the camera ISO set at 6400. The images are still not as sharp as I would have liked, but there was a slight breeze moving the flowers around. This was shot at the minimum focusing distance of the 500 mm lens.<br /><br />I did not try out the 2X Vivitar teleconverter that came with it.<br /><br />I only gave this 4 stars because I am not sure why there is some softness in my photos here. The fault is most likely due to the person taking the photos, me. But until I figure it out, the lens gets 4 stars. I will update sometime later.	2015-08-11

The tripods are possibly not of the sturdiest quality, but sturdy enough and easy to put up. The lights are great. They have fairly long cords so if you are lucky you may not need extensions. The only negatives I have found yet is that the backdrops being muslin are see-through so you need to be careful where you put your rig. If you have some clamps you could hang the black drop behind the white one which would help a little. They also need steamed to remove the creases from being packed in the bag and lastly, they are only 6ft wide so regardless of the fact that the stands are 10' wide the muslin is only 6' wide, which I guess if you want to rig both backdrops, side by side, you could, if your room is big enough. Overall this is a great deal and allows one to practice photography without breaking the bank. Unfortunately it will not make you a better photographer! But it will help.	2015-08-06

So, best bang for the buck, this light IS IT! The coverage area is very impressive. The red and green lasers cover damn near 180 degrees from side to side (The green is brighter if you're new to lasers). If you choose to control this light via a DMX controller, you can get almost every color combination imaginable. This is ideal if you do weddings and the bride requests a first dance light show with a specific color combination.<br /><br />If I had one grip it would be that it has no way of slowing down the lights without a DMX controller. It's pretty much full speed, all the time regardless of which pre-programmed light show you choose... Of course since I use the a DMX controller this is not an issue for me.<br /><br />The strobe LEDs are very bright and effective for their purpose. DO NOT STARE at them... Hopefully this goes without saying. Very great when programming them seeing as how they can each be programmed individually.<br /><br />The unit itself is very sturdy and I found the weight surprisingly light. I plan on ordering a second one within the next month due to it's versatility.<br /><br />***Special props for this light since it leaves my two cats busy for quite some time.	2015-07-14

But you get all the flexibility you need for shooting in any position. This harness seemed the closest to what I had made for myself. It works just as my old one did. My only issue is that the strap that runs through the back gusset is free to slide. It should be fixed at the middle of the strap so both sides always stay the same length.

But with some mildly frustrating quirks - that you'll learn to live with or work around. Get this camera.	PROS<br /><br />- Amazing photos! Of course. You already knew this. The shallow depth-of-field you can get with this is amazing, with the full-frame sensor, at maximum aperture. (Well technically, the sensor doesn't produce shallow depth of field, the lens focal length does. And at the same distance and framing, a larger sensor requires a longer focal length [shorter depth-of-field] than a smaller one. It's all interrelated.)<br /><br />- Love all the customizable buttons.<br /><br />- I can't get over the size of this thing. It's so small (yet useable). If you were to remove the battery grip, the swivel mechanism for the LCD monitor, and the viewfinder - this thing would fit in any pocket. (Well minus the lens.)<br /><br />- Multiple pro photography websites call this sensor the best currently in the world, or very close to it. The 55mm f/1.8 prime lens has been tested as the second-best lens ever tested by some magazine. (Behind a Leica lens.)<br /><br />- The idea of apps is pretty cool.<br /><br />- It has a really cool single-shot HDR-like feature (forgetting the name). Basically it takes a darker image than you chose, then brings up the shadows while leaving the highlights the same. I've used this exact same method for over a decade - I adjust exposure compensation down a couple of clicks, then bring the shadows up in post. This helps prevent blown-out highlights, and assuming your ISO is low enough, doesn't increase shadow noise much (because the camera can choose a lower ISO than you would use otherwise). The only drawback is that if you dial this effect up too much, the images look a little flat. There isn't as much contrast to pop. And there seems to be a slight &#34;HDR&#34;-ish local contrast effect. Not as obvious as HDR mode, but it I think it's there.<br /><br />- Focus peaking feature is awesome, even in the mostly auto-focus mode that also uses it.<br /><br />- Manual focusing is easy with automatic &#34;pixel zoom&#34; and focus peaking.<br /><br />- The continuous focus mode is really cool. You can focus and recompose, and watch the focus box follow what you originally focused on. (How do they do that! That's like machine vision. In a camera.)<br /><br />PSEUDO-CONS<br /><br />- Viewfinder isn't very good. Not high-res enough. But...what do you expect? You are buying a mirrorless camera! It's not an SLR.<br /><br />- The kit lens isn't amazing. Better than I feared, worse than I hoped. Will definitely invest in a more expensive lens.<br /><br />- The HDR feature does too much &#34;local contrast&#34; and looks too flat/&#34;HDR-ey&#34;. It would have been nice if there were a menu option letting you specify how to present the dynamic range. Specifically, instead of contrast masking with overdone local contrast, I'd rather it collapsed the dynamic range. And better yet, collapsed the dynamic range with more than 8 bits per color of JPEG; i.e., collapsed dynamic range with 16 bits-per-color raw. (Or even the native 14 bpc. You might think that 14 bpc only contains 75% more data than 8 bpc. You'd be wrong, it's actually 6,400% times more information.) But, sometimes it works pretty well.<br /><br />- Why doesn't focus peaking work in full auto-focus mode? It would be really nice to see what the autofocuser has decided will be in focus, above and beyond the crude green brackets/squares.<br /><br />CONS (-1 star for these)<br /><br />- Startup is too slow. Not intolerable, just too slow for a camera this expensive.<br /><br />- They give you two customizable dial positions that you can program however you want. That's great - Canon doesn't have that. But I need more!<br /><br />- Vignetting is quite noticeable at wide aperture, even in JPEG mode with automatic lens correction. At f/8.0 though, it goes away. But still - one of the main points of a full-frame sensor is getting that beautiful DOF, which means using wide aperture.<br /><br />- Camera has &#34;auto ISO&#34; setting, BUT NO MINIMUM SHUTTER SPEED SETTING! What the heck? Well actually it does - the minimum is 1/60. But it's not user-adjustable. 1/60 is not fast enough for longer focal lengths. Waiting for a firmware upgrade.<br /><br />- Sucker is LOUD. You'd think that with no mirror to flop out of the way, it would be whisper-quiet. Nope. Loud as heck. Somewhat satisfying, but still loud.<br /><br />CAN'T COMMENT<br /><br />I haven't done long exposures yet - which is something I like to do. Also haven't done timelapse video, something else I like to do.G! What the heck? Well actually it does - the minimum is 1/60.

It has a lot of padding inside which I like because I go backpacking often (in the wilderness and international travel) and it protects my camera very well when it is stuffed inside of a backpack. However, it clearly has the appearance of a 'camera bag' and for international travelers you may want something more discrete (I looked forever for a 'discrete' bag and did not find a good one...). I plan to rip off the logo and take off all of the orange trim when I travel abroad. Also, this bag does not appear fully waterproof (albeit I have not exposed it to water yet) but it does appear very durable and well constructed.<br /><br />Inside this bag I keep my camera (Nikon D3200 with kit lens), neck strap, CPL filter, lens hood, cleaning cloth and extra memory card. There is room for much more, I'm sure i could also fit a doubler lens, but this bag is still very compact. Overall very pleased, but it would be nice if it appeared more discrete and was waterproof.	2014-07-02

The latches take a bit of force to open, but I feel confident that my gear is safe inside. My primary use has been for the GoPro Hero 3+ with plenty of room for assorted accessories. I use this when the extra protection is needed for my equipment which is certainly not 100% of the time. For those other occasions, I have a POV case for storage or when the extra protection is not needed.<br /><br />I have also purchased a second set of foam inserts that I customized for various DSLR lenses. As another reviewer stated, the case is probably not large enough to provide ample padding for a DSLR body with lens attached, but would be sufficient for the camera body only. The extra foam inserts are about $12 per set.<br /><br />The pick and pluck foam included with the case provides easy customization for any type of application. There are three pieces (top and bottom are solid and the middle/main section is the customizable pick 'n pluck). I found that once I plucked out the general shape for the particular item, I could remove the whole block and then take a sharp knife to slice off a cross-section in order to have smaller items sit up at the perfect level.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great case when you need serious protection for sensitive or expensive gear. Being able to purchase additional sets of foam make this case usable for a variety of applications.	2014-04-23

It's a little strange coming off of a dslr to something like this but I adore it. I bought it because I needed an interesting light and compact point and shoot and really liked the originality of this camera. As far as the heavy weight people discuss on their reviews they are expecting because it is so small that it won't weigh anything, but Canon gave this little guy a full metal body. I am accepting of the weight, just because I know how sturdy this camera is. I have no issues with the screen only flipping 90 degrees, but then again I wasn't expecting it either. I also tried taking selfies and shot self video with no issues. So I don't really see why the screen flipping up is so important. I did use the screen for what Canon intended it for which was high, low and food photography and it was so much better than a standard non flip non swivel screen. The flash seems like a cell phone flash, but it's much more powerful and honestly much less fake looking than cell phone and camera flashes tend to be, which as I have noticed with all of my Canon cameras, seems to be a trend with their flashes. Battery life is a little short here though, but I'm just going to buy some backup batteries. I don't expect such a small camera to power an entire city over night like some people seem to. Overall VERY happy with this purchase and considering buying more for family. :)	2013-12-27

Camera	1	13	21	N	Y	Not for the Panasonic DMC-FZ70	Took delivery of my FZ70 on Sept. 4 (thanks Amazon!) and needed a decent camera case.  Had already bought the Case Logic Camera Holster and that was so large that the FZ70 was much to loose in it.  When I saw this MegaGear product online at Amazon advertising that it was for the FZ70 it was a no brainer to order it.  Amazon got here it in the two days my prime membership enjoys.  Wow this is a small case.  How small is it?  Well you probably want to take off the camera's shoulder straps and then you can actually get the camera to be inside the case and get the zipper closed with some work.  I would estimate that takes probably 30 seconds.  Then to get the camera out is like another 30 seconds.  Beyond the time which makes it ridiculous you stand the chance of actually hurting your camera.  Absolutely an unworkable case for the FZ70.<br /><br />I had bought the AGFA 55mm Heavy Duty Rubber Lens Hood from Amazon and you must take that off along with the shoulder straps to even have a chance to jam the camera into this case.<br /><br />This is just simply not a case for the FZ70.  Shipping back to Amazon.<br /><br />Rare for me to give a 'don't buy' rating but I have no choice here.  This case is not designed for the Panasonic DMC-FZ70 regardless of their advertising.	2013-09-07

WOW! These things are awesome. You can control EVERYTHING from behind the camera. Plus or minus 3 EV and full ETTL management. Buy them if you use ETTL and hate Canon's solution. Want to set up two strobes firing at 1/8  and 1/2 with one zoomed into 105 mm and the other at 50 mm?  You can do that too without visiting each device. In short these wireless 2.4 GHz triggers are very functional and have been flawless for me. They use AA batteries just like the strobes so everything's common there. You can even simulate a modeling light where the flash fires continually for 2 to 3 seconds. Also a test button is good for verification and works well.  I have sold my PW's and am a Odin Phottix fanboi now. :-)	2013-06-02

Probably have used it for around 60 hrs on my shoulder. I carry a Cannon 60D with the battery pack, big lens, and a flash. It handles the weight with no problem and its comfortable. I don't use the under arm strap. Im a big guy, 6.4, 250lbs, and I have found that the under arm strap for me is just a little binding. The only area I would improve on this strap is that it would be so much better if it had some kind of grip material on the bottom of the pad to keep the pad in place. The pad likes to wonder around from front to back of the shoulder. No big deal really. But with some grip on the bottom, this product would be perfect. Considering the cost of other straps of this type, this strap is a very good deal. The connection piece for the bottom of the camera is really well built. When I add another camera, this will be the first thing I buy for it.	2013-05-19

All other monopod heads in this class cost upwards of $240. As ALL of the 1-3 star reviews have noted, THIS HEAD IS FOR LENS MOUNT COLLARS. Monopods are designed to help support the weight of heavier lenses that need to be at the ready. Particularly useful for sports and wildlife photographers. SOME manufacturers have plate clamps that will rotate 90 degrees to allow for camera plate mounting while using smaller lenses. I am not going to argue the merits of this as I only use a monopod for glass 200mm or longer. If you want a bargain on an excellent mono head, buy this one. Just be aware of the \\\\\"limitation\\\\\" of only having use of the adjustable angle feature if used on a lens collar (as it was designed for)."	2013-03-30

If you've been looking around you will have noticed this rig is available from about nine different companies, in both the US and China. (Fancier studio, cowboy, flashpoint, digital juice, ephoto, walimex pro, viwe photo to name a few) plus a few places on aliexpress.com also sell it. I chose this one because it's one of the cheapest and ships from the US.<br /><br />From what I can tell it's made by a company called Ring Light in Shanghai and depite all its variations it always way has the model number &#34;RL-03&#34; or some variation. the prices vary slightly, but they all look identical, some come with an aluminum case, some come with the liliput monitor, but the actual rig is the same. It looks to me like a pretty close copy of the Red Rock Micro rig which, for everything included here I think costs around $4400.<br /><br />As for a review of the actual product, it's great. It feels really tough. I have a feeling some of the screws won't take years of tightening and un-tightening. Some of the adjustments feel a bit clunky, and not that smooth. It's easy to scratch things when adjusting. I feel like you can't be too rough with it, but remember this - this is pretty much the cheapest rig out there. If this is your price range I would recommend this rig, if you have $4400 obviously go get the Red Rock.<br /><br />Just to mention a few points from the other review, it fits my Manfrotto tripod head (502) just fine, though it's probably a bit too heavy for it. I'm thinking of getting the 504 to take all the weight. And the matte box DOES swing out. But it took me a while to work out how. I haven't tried filters. The handles are a little hard to tighten fully to take all the weight, but I have managed to do it.<br /><br />That said, I would love to replace it piece by piece with the Red Rock Micro over the next few years. But since that's not in the budget right now, I am more than happy with this rig.	2013-03-19

I put the Sunshade on my Canon and needed to extend the view finder so a couple of these and the Canon EP-EX 15 II all coupled together and you can shoot with the door open on the sunshade and it doesn't interfere with the eye that turns the screen off as you approach the viewfinder with you face.  The eyecup also helps me with smudges on my glasses, the eyepiece touches the glasses but very rarely smudges the glasses so this is great.  I bought the EP-EX 15 II, two of the rubber eyepieces and removed the rubber eyecup from one and put all 3 together and it gets me to the end of the opened sunshade and in place to make great shots.  The Canon EP 15 II was the most expensive part of this but the combined results are worth every penny.  I would recommend these products to anyone having a Canon that these will fit.  So great products, great companies to buy from.	2012-12-12

The lcd screen on the remote timer was practically unreadable.  Instead of the screen being (as it looks in the photos) like a plain light grey, it was dark, very dark.  I thought nothing of it until I installed the batteries and found that even the numbers, etc, were dark - so it was like dark numbers on a dark background.  Near impossible to read!  The ONLY way I could see what was on the lcd screen was turning the light on - even in a brightly lit room.  The remote I received had an obviously 'defective' lcd screen, but what made it even worse to me is that this remote (and the packaging) had clearly been opened, used, etc, as there was evidence of that.  It angered me that the SELLER of this item still tries to sell this remote and passes it off to me when determining that it has a defective lcd screen is as easy as just looking at it without batteries installed.  I give the seller ZERO stars for that, as it was clearly been used (or tested) before and still shipped it to me as if it worked.  That is bad.<br /><br />BTW, as far as the connection issues some have reported with this remote and the camera, this unit fit fine in my D7000 was snug but not too tight and removed easily enough.  No problems there.<br /><br />Otherwise, the remote is a little cheaply made but it isn't a Nikon brand item but for the price, as long as it works, it will be completely acceptable.  So I'm going to try and find a different seller, hoping for one that is not put together with defective parts.	2012-10-01

I should point out that this camera is so easy too use, and so easy too capture all of the still pictures or videos that you will want, including the sound. I myself will add the rode videomic pro with the rode dead cat wind muff for a better audio. However; the audio is acceptable, if you are in close proximity to the camera. The Panasonic DMC-FZ150 is a winner.	2012-09-29

The only bummer is since they snap on, that means they can also snap off.  That's how I've managed to lose two in the past; I've just been walking around while on vacation, with my camera over my shoulder and it's bumped something causing the protector to pop off and I've lost it. There's one somewhere in New Hampshire and one floating in the Caribbean Sea. (Yeah, bummer)<br /><br />Anyway, the protector is plastic, but is of great quality.  For a few bucks you can't go wrong.  I live in IL and these ship from CA.  It arrived really quick (in 3 business days) and just in time for my next vacation.  ...Here's hoping I won't lose it again. :)	2012-07-17

US	43362091	RQ3K0J9HK567E	B006K551LM	615983402	Sony Bloggie Live(MHS-TS55) Video Camera with 4x Digital Zoom, 3.0-Inch Touchscreen LCD and WiFi Connectivity (2012 Model)	Camera	4	31	32	Y	N	Capable, well designed camcorder	"Many people now ignore handheld camcorders because they have them built into their phones, iPods, and other devices, but is this reason enough?  I can think of many reasons people may want a dedicated device, so this review doesn't presume that the Sony Bloggie is obsolete simply because \\\\\"my iPod does the same thing\\\\\".<br /><br />The Bloggie Live incorporates WiFi to allow many of the things that make iPod Touch, iPhone, and Android phone so popular - easy sharing.  It also does some cool things like transferring your pictures and videos to other phones & iPod by creating a peer-to-peer wireless network using an app.  The advantage is that you can selectively transfer 1 or multiple files all in one session rather than sending each by text message/mms/or synching to a computer.<br /><br />Not everyone is going to have a smartphone with data plan, and the Bloggie offers better resolution and expanded options compared to an iPod touch.  I'll examine the performance, the realistic usage of these features, and comparisons in my review here.<br /><br />__________<br />Startup<br />__________<br />It turns on quickly, within about a second.  Autofocus takes about 1-2 seconds for stills, and a bit longer for quick changes in focus length when shooting video.  It's nice that with a dedicated button for stills there's no delay when switching from video to stills.  You can also shoot stills while recording video.<br /><br />___________<br />Touchscreen<br />___________<br />The touchscreen is very large, well detailed and color accurate.  The problem is the touch part.  I often have to hit things 2 or 3 times to get it to register, usually for specific buttons on the screen.  Using it to zoom seems ok, though.  Usually deliberate presses work better than a quick tap or slide. Simply put, it's not on-par with what you get from an Apple touchscreen.<br /><br />__________<br />SteadyShot<br />__________<br />One word: Awesome.  Compared to an iPhone, there simply is no comparison.  The Sony blows the iPhone out of the water.  You can walk with the Bloggie and still have surprisingly good video.  With the iPhone, you'll see every bounce.  This is a key feature that sets the Bloggie apart and should be a consideration if you really want a pocket camcorder.  It works REALLY well and makes taking video while walking and moving a good experience rather than a motion-sickness inducing roller coaster ride.  With small devices, handshake and movement is amplified since they're so light.  Steadyshot not only evens out this unintentional movement, but also helps smooth out panning (turning the camera side-to-side).  These are very real and common scenarios that everyone will appreciate.  If you plan to really use video often, this feature is one that should be high on your priority list.<br /><br />________________<br />Resolution Modes<br />________________<br />To be honest, I didn't see much difference between 1080p, 720p, and 720p60fps.  I took the raw video and froze the frames, and there wasn't really a whole lot of difference in terms of jaggies or resolution.  With the 720p mode at 60fps it didn't seem to stop the action any better during a freeze frame, and the odd thing was that the bitrate was lower than the regular 720p mode.  In all, I'm suspecting that the higher compression necessary in the 1080 and 60p modes reduces some of the benefit you'd otherwise get.  All that said, when shooting in 1080 mode, I still felt comfortable zooming in a small amount without the video greatly suffering.<br /><br />_______________<br />Audio Recording<br />_______________<br />The Bloggie has stereo mic's set into the unit and it does a good job of picking up the audio you want.  I didn't notice any extraneous background noise and voices and other sounds were realistic.  Wind noise wasn't too bad of a problem, either.  The only negative I could see here is that there's no audio-in jack, nor is there a headphone jack for playback.  Therefore playback hasto be done with the built-in speaker.<br /><br />______________<br />Tripod support<br />______________<br />The Bloggie does have a tripod mount located next to the flip-out USB cable.  The only downside here is that it's not centered with the lens.<br /><br />____________<br />AF/Metering<br />____________<br />Autofocus is fairly decent, though it is basically center-weighted to the closest object, unless it recognizes a face.  Facial recognition occurs automatically and the screen will show a green box around the identified face.  It will identify faces anywhere in the frame, not just near the center, and will continue to track them as they move.  Unfortunately, there's no tap-to-focus ability for situations where your target is off-center or the wrong face is identified.  Sometimes it does hunt for focus and on occasion it wouldn't pick up focus until it could identify the edge of an object.  In all, it's not as good as a traditional camcorder, but decent for a device in this category.  It's much better than the fixed focus that some devices use.  It can focus as close as about 4-5 inches from the subject.<br /><br />Similarly, metering seems pretty much center-weighted or matrixed as well, with no additional options.  Overall, the metering performs well, though I really miss the tap-to-focus/meter option that the iPhone has.  With high contrast scenes, it gradually adjusts metering so that you don't get huge swings in brightness all at once, and it responds to changing lighting conditions pretty quickly.<br /><br />______________________<br />Low Light Performance<br />______________________<br />The Sony had a more incandescent color tint in low-light, even when I was in pure fluorescent lighting conditions.  The LED is of limited use and won't substitute true fill-lighting.  It has a pretty narrow arc, and is best used for objects directly in-line with the LED and less than about 3-4 feet away.  Additionally, focusing in low-light is near impossible.  In a room lit with a single lamp objects are visible in the screen, but the Bloggie can't focus on them.  Turning on the LED didn't help much unless the object was 3-4 feet from it.<br /><br />_______<br />Editing - there's no editing of any kind on the Bloggie itself.<br />_________<br /><br />______________<br />Live Streaming<br />______________<br />Live streaming is amazingly easy.  Just have viewers go to your Qik.com page, press Menu, then Live Streaming on your Bloggie, then begin recording.  While on my home network there was only about a 3-second delay in the live feed.  Quality was pretty good as well - not super high resolution like those that you record, however, more than good enough for web video.  Users watching your feed can type in messages which then appear on your Bloggie, but there's no way to respond to them other than by talking into the Bloggie.  The other minor issue is that if you're recording in the vertical, the text messages come through only on the horizontal.<br /><br />The great thing about the Live Streaming is that the Bloggie is recording a full-resolution version at the same time, so you don't have to choose between live feed and high quality for later playback - you get both.  This is definitely an advantage.<br /><br />Compared to Facetime, Qik with the Bloggie gives your better quality video, ability to have full-resolution saved permanently and you can broadcast to an unlimited number of people.  The downside is that the only way a viewer can interact is by typing a text into Qik's viewer.<br /><br />It should be noted that Qik works with smartphones as well, so you don't NEED a Bloggie to do live streaming - you can do it from supported smartphones as well.<br /><br />__________________<br />View on Smartphone<br />__________________<br />This is a pretty cool option.  When activating this option, the Bloggie creates its own wireless network.  You then go to your smartphone, join this wifi network and start the app.  Just rememberto start the Bloggie first, or else you get a really cryptic error message from the app on your smartphone.  Once connected, you can view a thumbnail of every file on the Bloggie and selectively choose which ones to transfer to your phone.  The transfer is very quick, and it transfers the entire file.  This is a good way to share pics and videos from the Bloggie if you don't have wifi available.  My only watchout is to be careful of letting others connect to your Bloggie - as I said, there's no filtering of the files, so they'll have access to everything stored on it.<br /><br />________________<br />Facebook Sharing<br />________________<br />Well, it doesn't work.  Period.  When trying to post a video to Facebook, I entered my login info and it popped up a screen on the Bloggie asking to install the Bloggie Live app for Facebook.  It then failed the install saying \\\\\"An error occurred with Bloggie Live.  Please try again later.\\\\\"  Searching directly on Facebook for the app leads to a dead page.  Sony failed on this one.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________<br />Software, Qik, and PlayMemoriesOnline setup experience<br />_______________________________________________________<br />Of the setup steps, only downloading of the Play Memories software actually worked.  Download was easy and fast.  Selecting the custom install only lets you customize installation path and if you want desktop icons created.  It's pretty good - a basic but easy to use interface with many options for capturing and storing your pictures and video.  If you let it, it will scan and import all existing files on your PC.  I chose to only monitor and scan the directory where my Bloggie downloads to, as I already use Photoshop Elements to manage all my files.  There's lots of customization for importing, how to organize files (folders by date, by import date, etc), as well as options for WiFi transfer and more.  I'm usually not a fan of included software, but this seems pretty well done.<br /><br />_______<br />Editing<br />_______<br />Basic image manipulation is available in the PC software.  Video editing is limited to trimming the ends of the video file as well as converting to WMV.  Sony is introducing some sort of editor for the PS3, but since I don't own one I can't comment further.  There is no editing on the Bloggie itself - everything must be done on your computer.<br /><br />_________<br />Wifi sync<br />_________<br />The PlayMemories Home software has included options for automatically syncing your files via Wifi for supported devices.  Cool, the Bloggie Live has wifi, right?  No go - there's no options on the Bloggie itself for enabling this and by default the Bloggie doesn't turn on wifi until you start a function that requires it.  Even with the Playmemories Home software turned on and trying to access wifi features on the Bloggie Live, it never popped up as a connected device within the desktop software.<br /><br />___________________<br />PlayMemories Online<br />___________________<br />The link to PlayMemories Online was inactive (and marked as coming in spring).<br /><br />_________________________________________<br />Qik.com service (Live streaming provider)<br />_________________________________________<br />The link to Qik, the service that allows the live streaming didn't work from within the PlayMemories software.  Clicking the button in the installer tries to launch a webpage on Sony's Japan site that isn't active.  Going to Qik.com manually works well enough, though, and they even have a special button to press for the Sony Bloggie.  I chose to sign in using Facebook, which is a mistake.  Creating an account in this way gives you a really bad username \\\\\"fb-user-10digitnumber\\\\\".  The username is easily changeable in your Qik account profile, but the larger issue is that you don't know your Qik account password until you find the email it sends you.  Gmail captured the email as spam, so beware.  Next you'llprobably want to reset it on Qik's website because you can't sign in to Qik on the Bloggie using the Facebook option.  The other crappy thing is that Qik wants access to two things in your Facebook profile: 1. Access to post on your wall - ok, fair enough that if I'm going to use this thing to take a video then I'd probably want the ability for it to post it to my wall.  2. Access to posts in my newsfeed - I don't think so.  Why should Qik need access to anything in my newsfeed?  I chose to uncheck this option, however each time you log in to Qik.com using Facebook, it will re-ask for that access.<br />Qik was recently acquired by Skype, so this seems to speak pretty well for it.  Note that you can use Qik with most smartphones in addition to the Bloggie.  Therefore, you can get similar live-streaming with your phone, but I don't know that it'll also record the full-quality video like the Bloggie does.  The free version of the service allows you to do live broadcasts up to a limited length (approximately 20-30 minutes).  You'll have to upgrade if you want additional storage or longer broadcast lengths.<br /><br />___________<br />Conclusion<br />___________<br />The Bloggie is a good choice for someone who either doesn't have a decent camera/video camera on a phone or mp3 player, as it does basically everything those devices do.<br />It also has several features not found on iOS: stills while recording, steadyshot, stereo sound, dedicated still/video buttons, 60p mode, and direct sharing with other smartphones to name a few.  I found myself reaching for the Bloggie when I knew I'd want to take some video rather than relying on my iPhone.  Therefore, I could also say this is a good choice for someone not entirely happy with the camera on their phone.<br />The negative points for this device are that the software isn't completely ready and several features just don't work (ie Facebook sharing).  Also, the weird error messages and touchscreen lack of sensitivity are two examples of things that detract from the experience, but may not be issues for some people.<br />In all, I really like the Bloggie Live despite its few shortcomings and feel that it's a dependable solution providing better video than my phone.ick, and it transfers the entire file.

I was really pleased with what I got for the price! $100 gets you all set up to begin your journey into the cosmos.  There are definite shortcomings with this scope, firstly as mentioned before the finder scope is very hard to use for objects far above the horizon, also there is no way to collimate the scope without serious modifications that could easily destroy the scope.  Now on the positive side, it's extremely light which makes it ideal for quick viewings or take for travel.  I use this scope every single clear night I possibly can, just have it on the kitchen table take it out back when the skies are clear and voila.  I think that most people's opinions of this scope will be based on their expectations, don't think you will get hubble scope views.    What you will see.  Moon:  Great views, nice clear detail on the craters.  The scope is small enough you don't need a moon filter to keep from going blind, unless you're going to do some extended lunar viewing.  Jupiter:  You can definitely see some of the cloud bands and if the skies are not too turbulent the detail will be all the better, the Galilean moons are also really easy to see (Hint: for better views of Jupiter get the moons in focus.)  Saturn:  I haven't had this scope during a good period of viewing yet, but what I was able to see were the rings and the moon Titan, the color was not very distinguishable though.  Mars:  I'm waiting for March to see what it can do.  So far it's just been a reddish/brown dot.  Pleiades:  Very nice cluster to check out, you can see quite a few stars in it.  Orion Nebula (M42):  This will look like a small star luminated smudge, pretty cool though.  I live in an extremely light polluted area, and this scope still does well.  If you're going to get any accessories I would recommend the Shorty Barlow.	2011-12-03

I know how to zoom in and out, point, push the shutter button half way down to let the camera focus and then pull the trigger.  I also know what a clear, real-to-life picture looks like.  I have 2 other cameras.  A Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 and a Nikon Coolpix S200.  I use the Panasonic whenever I know I'm going some place that the size of the camera will not be a hindrance.  It's the size and shape of a typical SLR camera.  It also takes incredible pictures - even in my hands.  Love it.  I use the S200 for everything else.  It's a nice albeit limited camera.  The zoom is only 3x and the flash leaves something to be desired.  I purchased the S9100 to replace the S200 and will keep the S200 around in the glove box for times I didn't bring one of the others and to use as a sort of \\\\\"I don't care what happens to it\\\\\" camera like when skiing or sailing.  For testing purposes I put the S9100 head to head with the Panasonic.  I took pictures at various zoom lengths, in different lighting conditions both with and without flash and snapped some moving pictures of kids riding bikes, cars going down the street and people playing with their dogs in the nearby park.  I would snap a picture with the Panasonic and then with the S9100.  While the moving pictures were impossible to truly replicate I kept things as consistent as I could with zoom length, using or not using flash, etc..  Then, I took them back home, removed the SD cards and looked at the photos on my PC using Picasa.  The S9100 consistently took absolutely fabulous pictures.  It equaled the Panasonic in clarity and overall true-to-life representation.  Plus, it bested the Panasonic in low light situations and the extra zoom length (the Panasonic maxes out at 12x) allowed me to get in a little closer.  The S9100 has a personality.  You could almost call it an attitude.  Sometimes, it couldn't focus perfectly creating a blurry picture.  This was solved by either changing the zoom or stepping forwards or back a step.  It wasn't often and the Panasonic displayed some of the same behavior.  The S9100 seemed to perform flawlessly if what I was photographing was maybe 4 feet away or further.  Up closer, it would sometimes have focus difficulty.  What you see on the screen is absolutely what you get.  When you push the shutter button half way down to let the camera focus it will show you exactly what your picture will look like.  Believe the screen.  I have large, heavy hands that just don't get along with today's little things.  The S200 was often a struggle for me.  The S9100 feels comfortable (although I wouldn't complain if it were heavier) and the controls react nicely to my less than deft meat hooks.  I had no problems with the zoom ring after a few minutes with the camera and the button you slide down to engage the flash was immediately intuitive and easy to operate.  Looking at and deleting pictures was also thumb friendly.  No fussing or cursing with this one.  I call this one a keeper.  The picture quality, even when super-zooming in on the photo in Picasa are crystal clear, the zoom works well without sacrificing picture quality, the flash is basically incredible and I found the entire camera to be easy to use.  All that is left to find out is if it holds up over the long haul."	2011-11-22

"Just received my Nikon S8200 today.  There are tons of features on this camera, some of which I may never use but it's nice to have them.  I read some reviews about the camera before purchasing it, the most frequent complaint of which related to the auto flash.  It is located right where your left index finger normally rests on the top left surface of the camera and the flash pops up into your finger.  It's kind of annoying and makes me wonder why Nikon designed it that way.  Additionally, you can't push the flash back down manually. You must shut the camera off completely which automatically retracts the flash.  Then you have to turn the camera back on.  Weird!!  The other thing that is lacking is a hard copy of the User Manual.  It comes with a very brief \\\\\"Quick Start\\\\\" manual and a disk to download the big manual but no hard copy to carry with you.  The disk is printable but a book would be nice. Otherwise it's a beautiful piece, seems solid and well made and I'm looking forward to a lot of good use."	2011-10-20

I got this camera, because I'm about to have a little girl and I wanted to take better pictures than I could with my Droid. Now that I have it, and have taken some pictures, I want to take more pictures of everything. I see amazing shots all around me everyday now.  It does have a little bit of a learning curve to it, if you've never used a DSLR (I think all DSLRs do though). There are only two complaints that I have. The first one is a lack of AEB (automatic exposure bracketing). I've seen some really amazing shots that are HDR (high dynamic range) images. The easiest way to do these kinds of shots is with AEB, but that option is reserved for the higher end Nikons. You can still achieve HDR shots without AEB, but you need to either use the timer to reduce shake, or a remote shutter. Which brings me to my second issue with this camera. The D3100, from my understanding, replaces the D3000. The D3000 has an infrared sensor on the front for using a wireless remote shutter. For some reason Nikon removed the sensor from the D3100. You can still purchase a corded remote, or a wireless remote that comes with a wired sensor, but it would have been nice if Nikon had made it easier to take HDR shots on this camera. If you are aware of these two things, and still purchase the camera, I think you will be happy.	2011-10-11

I  have always used a 'regular' jeweler's loupe but needed a higher power to identify identify biting bugs.<br /><br />PRO: Let's just say I was shocked...it worked! I saw things I did not expect to see and not just bugs. Couldn't understand why we all have bites on us that won't heal, itched, felt fatigued and ached. Now I go to the Dr. with proof so hopefully our family can be treated immediately.  I could see things in detail I couldn't see with a 20x loupe at all! This opened up a new world for me.  The little dots  we see as dust are not always dust!  It has served it's purpose.  I just hope that now  that I have found out  things with it I won't be addicted to checking every little piece of dust. It could drive a person crazy!  This seems to be a quality product.<br /><br />CON: Be prepared if you haven't used a microscope or don't remember from high school when you did use one!  This is not a regular loupe it is a microscope.  With a loupe you just look in it and see your item and that's it.  No focusing to do.  I had trouble adjusting the zoom and focus to get the results.  First of all the things I was looking at were the size of dust or less. It took me lots of time to even find them with the loop ( I had them on transparent tape) and when I finally did, I had a heck of a time focusing it right.  The microscope is small and I had trouble holding it, finding the things, focusing it and then I kept hitting the zoom and focus buttons accidentally with my fingers, would move the tape and have to find the thing all over again.  You have to move it the opposite direction you really need to go to as everything  is reversed. Had trouble getting use to that. I ended up with headaches from squinting and bending my neck down for so long. Ouch!  The light is still working, but dim, so I have to buy more batteries, of course.<br /><br />I believe this item works just as it is suppose to.  I am just not use to using a microscope. For those who are use to it or a quicker study than me, you will love it.  I am also going to order a regular loupe with higher power to see if I can see what I need to with that as it is so much faster and easier. I doubt it though.	2011-08-09

If you are happy with your present camera strap, then the Strap Buddy will make your photography a little more comfortable at a fraction of the cost of other solutions. It takes that camera that is banging against your chest or stomach and puts it comfortably at your side.  If you have a good sized DSLR or SLR with a heavy lens, this item becomes aces in taking strain off the back of your neck. It is sturdy built. It removes from the tripod attachment location if needed without the use of any tools. My camera (Canon XTi) hangs comfortably and ready for quick access at my hip just below my waist. My lens points down at maybe a 45 degree angle.  The Strap Buddy and a good camera strap is a good thing.	2011-06-28

I have multiple pocket sized digital cameras from Canon, and this case is great because it's compatible with all of them.  I can also loan the case to my friends and family and it works with their cameras.  It's way cheaper than buying the custom cases offered by Canon which can run $100+.<br /><br />This case is pretty much a fancy ziplock bag, and probably costs them like $1 to make.  However, I am very pleased with the case so far.  I haven't had any problems with water leakage, and my pictures have all come out wonderfully clear.  I even took some underwater video which came out really nice.  Even though the case is significantly larger than my camera, it's still easy enough to position the camera, and I don't consider it a hassle to use at all.  The case is also fold-able, lightweight, and compact which makes it ideal for travel.<br /><br />I used to have a custom Canon camera case which I paid $150 for.  That case worked great and I was happy with it, but it was useless once I upgraded cameras.  This cheap case does the same thing for 20% of the price.  Overall, for the price and durability, you can't beat this.  Get one!	2011-04-19

When I stumbled across reviews on this Fancier FT-717AH fluid head for $70 that many are using for their DSLRs, I was intrigued. I like to travel and don't want to check multiple bags. Because this ow cost head got such nice reviews got such nice reviews, I thought I'd give it a try with my little set of under $80 aluminum tripod (Giotto's MTL 9240B). I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth and solid the head is. It's very capable of handling the weight of more than a DSLR set up. It's a bit stiff in the panning as many bloggers will tell you, but some like prefer it that way. You can open and clean out the existing panning grease and replace it with a silicon grease for looser panning in about 20 minutes. Having done that, it's a perfect little head for a one-man-shooting band. Deserves 5 stars because it's only $70 and works great and it ties right on to my backpack.	2011-03-31

I enter this review with mixed feelings. I received my Nikon D90 around Jan 4th this year and was instantly amazed with its ability. Because of my previous experience with the D50, it did not take long to get accustom with the D90 and was quite surprised at the ease of familiarizing myself with the new camera. I did try to read up as much as possible because I feel that is the most importand thing to do in photography, knowing your camera inside and out. For the first two weeks, I would say it performed beautifully,as expected. However shortly there after I began noticing pictures that were grossly underexposed speradically through a shoot. I shoot sporting events indoor with various lighting. Here are my usual settings. ISO-1600 to 2000 with High ISO NR on,WB-K at various settings depending on lighting, burst and single exposure modes, AF area mode-Dynamic area,Center focus point-wide,Meter-Center weighted. I shoot approximately 200-400 photos over a period of about 3 hours with several breaks throughout the session. Photos in question are almost completely backed out but look as though they are very underexposed with just hints of the subject on the outer edges. These photos will be scattered about the shoot so it has been very difficult to pinpoint exactly what might be going on to cause this but I have been very surprised with that this is happening. The last session, I had about 25-30 of these misshots in a little over 400 photos. The Customer Service Dept. has been very gracious and helpful to try to resolve this problem and after talking to Nikon USA and Amazon Support, I have a new camera being shipped as a replacement. I am very pleased with this as I feel like it is a defect with the camera and did not feel like this problem should be showing up this soon. The D50 never has had any problem like this but it does not have the setting capability that the D90 has, so I will not try tocompare their performances. I hope the problem is with this particular camera and not the model. I am a Nikon fan and will continue to be but this is a discouraging chapter in my history with Nikon products. I will certainly update my review and star rating after I have had a chance to use the new camera.	2010-02-10

They were old-school before there was old-school.  Their bags are aimed at the pro and amateur wanting some of the pro tools.  When I say pro, I am referring to the beat photojournalists working on a deadline or the world traveling journalist on harsh urban safaris throughout the world.<br /><br />Bag is built with heavy canvas and luxuriant leather trim, like you would find in a fine English car.  The interior is thickly padded in a dark contrasting green.  And like most things of this quality the buckles and belts and gussets and straps and zippers are all heavy duty and get more comfortable with use.<br /><br />The pluses are:<br /><br />1.  It is like carrying the LandRover of bags (for those in the know).<br />2.  It feels like it would stop a speeding bullet to protect your gear<br />3.  The \\\\\"reporter\\\\\" top is a gape mouth that opens and closes easily to give you quick access to your gear with a generous flap to keep out the elements<br />4.  There are lots of pockets to stow (and forget where you put) the odd photo bits<br />5.  Holds a body-lens and 1 or 2 additional lenses comfortably (about all you really need on the move)<br /><br />The minuses are:<br />1.  Like a LandRover it is heavy.<br />2.  It is old-school in that it does not have lots of netted see thru space or small storage places for modern photo equipment (SD Cards, batteries, etc).  Everything defaults to oversized pockets for you to fish around in.<br /><br />If you like the status of a great bag or a throwback to traditional style this is your bag.  If you want the latest bells and whistles or light weight this may not be it.<br /><br />One final note: this is a purpose built bag, so would only recommend for photography.<br /><br />If in doubt go with the black - it looks good in all situations.  The khaki is a little too safari... unless you are going on safari."	2009-09-30

My Lowepro Slingshot 200 all weather backpack worked very well.  I could swing it around and get the gear I needed.  I have had headaches from the camera strap around my neck on hikes so I wanted to try a backpack.  At age 54 it  worked much better. I still had some aches with a long hike, but no headaches.  If you carry more gear, this can carry camera, extra lens, flash, small handycam recorder, and all the extra items for using them. I lightened the pack of extras when I knew I would not use all the gear and that helped with the weight.	2009-07-03

"I have used Canon small cameras (ELPHS and SureShots) extensively for at least 15 years, for thousands of vacation and family photos under all sorts of conditions.  Because I am always dropping cameras and cell phones, I decided to try the \\\\\"unbreakable\\\\\" Olympus 850SW.  Well, I might not drop it; I might THROW it at something after trying to use it for two months.  (1)  The battery life is nonexistent.  I hardly ever had to charge any of my Canons; they would run for two days of constant shooting on vacation, for example.  This Olympus battery dies in a half-hour. (2) The storage card is, as many have pointed out, uncommon.  It turns out to really annoy me to have to carry an extra cable, etc.  (3)  Despite its 20+ special settings, I couldn't get a single decent picture at an indoor fashion show, not with any setting, not in regular auto mode--nothing.  Again, in comparison to the long list of Canons I've had, this is pathetic.  I never had to worry about focus with a Canon.  This camera looks cool and may be indestructible; it's just not a good CAMERA."	2008-12-31

I also own a Canon PowerShot G9 so I find myself comparing the two all the time. With that said, I wasn't expecting anything with ultra low noise. The G9 noise levels are unacceptable (in my opinion) at any ISO setting over 200. Having come from this same type of CCD, I wasn't expecting miracles so I'm not disappointed. If anything, I think the noise is on par or a little less noticeable on the P6000 than it is on the G9. That was a surprise considering that the P6000 is packing in more pixels on the same sized CCD. Here's my summary:<br /><br />Noise = not great, but not bad at all as long as you stay ISO 200 or lower. If you go up to 400 and above, plan on using noise reduction software.<br /><br />Optics = not tack sharp like you can get out of a dSLR, but, again, not bad. It reminds me of a good mid-range P&S camera in terms of optics. I think the G9 might be a little better here.<br /><br />GPS = great! I really love this. Two words of warning: it eats the battery quickly and it takes a while to lock on to the GPS signal (especially if you are in a city like Chicago). Once it's locked on, the GPS coordinates are pretty accurate.<br /><br />Speed = Good. I found the camera responsive. No speed demon, but shutter lag isn't a problem and all the camera functions are fairly snappy.<br /><br />Mac Compatible = 50/50. It's terrible if you're expecting native Mac support from Nikon on it's new RAW format. It's great if you're just shooting JPG images. I only use a Mac, but third-party solutions are already available to let you process the RAW files on your Mac. Lightroom 2.1 is compatible with the new format and so is Adobe's Camera RAW 4.6 plugin for Photoshop and Photoshop Elements. I've been shooting almost exclusively with RAW and happily processing them on my Mac with no problems at all.<br /><br />Size = GREAT! I love the size. It's just about the same physical size as the G9, but it's twice as light. It's much easier to take this camera long and stuff it into a loose pocket. You almost don't know it's there. Anything smaller would have been too small.<br /><br />Vibration Reduction = a must have. It really works well, especially in lower light settings.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this camera if you want a high-quality compact camera that has GPS, RAW and great creative control. It is a nice camera to take along with you when you just don't feel like pulling out the dSLR, but don't expect it to be a dSLR replacement because it's not. I'm quite happy with it and look forward to using it more and more.s much easier to take this camera long and stuff it into a loose pocket. You almost don't know it's there.

While most stores display the XTi and eventually the XSi, the XT is adequate for my needs. I believe I do not need the potentially ineffective sensor cleaning feature, live view, eye proximity detector, extra focal points, or the extra resolution. I ordered the XT with the EF-S 18-55mm 3.5-5.6 IS lens for only around $180. After buying the 4 GB Sandisk CF card I spent less than $700 total. A few years ago, I would only be a able to buy a high-end point and shoot camera. In the near future, I plan to buy the EF 50mm 1.8 II prime lens as well.     Pros:  -Inexpensive  -Compact; great for traveling, even fits in my backpack with my 18-55mm IS attached.  -Very good ISO performance from 100-800. 1600 is OK  -Handy back-lit monochrome LCD display  -Built-in flash for starting out in dSLR photography and hot-shoe for future external flash  -Very fast response  -Shutter, aperture, and focus point display in viewfinder.  -Custom functions allow some tweaking.     Cons:  -Changing white balance, ISO, AF mode, and light metering requires use of the color LCD screen that is hard to see in sunlight. I wish the shortcut buttons just toggle through the settings and that I could see the resulting changes on the monochrome LCD.  -No spot metering  -Thumb wheel is too firm to easily rotate  -CF pins may be easy to bend resulting in expensive repairs	2008-03-27

HOWEVER - the design and build of the neck (yoke) and leg assembly is weak.  The unit I received actually \\\\\"twists\\\\\" as I pan the camera.  Even with the leg spreader wide open, the yoke assembly that supports the legs at the top is just not adequate for the resistance offered by the pan head.  I could try reinforcing the yoke by adding screws through it into each leg but I'm sure that would void the warranty.    My $60. Velbon brand tripod is more sturdy in this regard however its pan head is not as good as the Sony and it it does not have the remote control.    The remote control on the handle requires a \\\\\"LANC\\\\\" connection receptacle on the camcorder.  It will start and stop the tape in the camera.     The problem is with the zoom control.  Although it allows you to smoothly vary the speed of the zoom, the design is backwards!  The zoom requires the camera operator to push backward to zoom IN and forward to zoom OUT - the exact opposite of the zoom rocker switch on the camera!!! Totally illogical. I could get used to it but it's just another unnecessary quirk to put up with.    I will probably be returning this unit or at least exchanging it for another in the hope that its legs don't twist."	2007-06-30

However, the thrill QUICKLY wore off.  The overall image quality is quite poor.  Standing a foot from the image, you can see pixelation.  The frame really works best for viewing 5 or more feet away.  For a 5 inch frame, that isn't exactly ideal.  If you are interested in image quality, I would not recommend this frame.  However, if you're looking for a cheap digital picture frame and image quality isn't a huge issue, this is probably the frame for you.	2007-06-27
US	48667346	RZM3EXTYVZQL1	B000HAOVC6	263432134	Canon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom	Camera	5	29	29	N	N	Great - Even for a first-timer!	Aye, this camera is great. I suppose I might be biased, this being my first digital, but I have used cameras borrowed from pals in the recent past, and didn't particularly enjoy them (which is why I wasn't too interested in a digi before). <br /> <br />Quick startup is a big bonus. On my trip earlier this year, I missed many opportunities for good photos with my pal's HP camera, as it took a few seconds to boot, and seconds between photos. The only video I took had to be tossed due to the 15fps blurry quality (and he had no memory card). The digital zoom was horrible, and indoors photos were really crappy - especially at night. <br /> <br />The 30fps movie mode in the A630 is wonderful for a camera of this price - I never use the 15fps mode at all - it's blurry and the picture is 'jumpy,' although if it's done outdoors with good ambient lighting, it seems to work a bit better. I quickly learned to navigate the settings, being a complete novice, but I still need to check the manual on a couple of items that I have no idea about. <br /> <br />Even though it won't fit in my pocket and is heavier than many, the battery life is great. I have the camera over a month now, have taken video, stills with and without flash, deleted and re-shot stuff, and still have not changed the original batteries. If this were my pal's camera, I would have changed batteries after about 8 or so shots. Serious. <br /> <br />I bought a 2GB SD card for it, along with rechargeables and a charger. The only off-key thing I noticed so far is that the images can get pretty grainy on night-time zoomed indoor shots where incandescent (normal) light bulbs are used. As one other reviewer said, I don't know if I have to tinker with the settings to fix this, but that's the only issue I have had. <br /> <br />So basically these things do it for me with this camera: <br /> <br />- Excellent battery life - AA size is easy to get and keep for emergencies <br />- Excellent video capture with sound <br />- Quick boot and inter-shot response <br />- Excellent image quality with little or no blur <br />- Nice features such as color swap and pre-sets for common situations, apart from manual settings for more advanced users. <br />- Foldable vari-angle LCD is very very useful - the screen won't get damaged once it's folded in - unlike those with the screen showing at the back. This is great for evaluating your shots, and the quality is pretty good for a small screen. <br />- Image quality settings allow for maximized space utilization on you SD. (GET a 1-Gig or larger card!) <br /> <br />Drawbacks: <br /> <br />- Some grainy zoomed indoor shots (moreso in nighttime video capture) <br />- Larger than expected <br />- Haven't been able to find the correct carrying case up to December 2006! What?! <br />- Causes me to waste time instead of preparing for my exams! :) <br /> <br />Overall, an easy-to-use, excellent camera, straight out of the box. Would recommend it (and already did - 3 of my coworkers are ordering it, so Canon please organize my cut). <br /> <br />ML.	2006-12-07

I had no idea what I was in for when I started this book. I stayed in a constant state of raised eyebrow unbelieving snorts throughout.  I really loved Lex who is a successful fashion designer.  I admired her smarts and her sass.  She kept me laughing with quips like, &#34;calm your kitty&#34;, and &#34;earth to my muffin&#34;.  I enjoyed her close relationship with her crazy friends who were fun and always had her back.  It was interesting to take a ride on the fashion train as I experienced it from a Designer's point of view.<br /><br />Masi, or Prince of Poo, as he was referred to by Lex's protective girlfriend, is a hottie.  He is so hot that Lex named her BOB after after him when she saw him in the gossip magazines.  She referred to him as being hot, hung, rich, and hard-bodied.  The Prince is very formal and tries to keep his distance but life gets in the way and they are thrown together an forced to spend time together.  At first I didn't believe their relationship and didn't feel their connection.  I felt the sex scenes were over the top and some of the expressions distasteful.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE dirty talk and steamy sex.  And there was plenty of that.  By the end of the book I was convinced and very attached to the characters.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Undressed and I'm looking forward to reading Unscrupulous and all of the other books in the Manhattanites series.  Avery Aster is a talented author, I like knowing that I can expect love, laughs, steamy sex, and a HEA with no fear of a cliffie.	2013-08-27

Each of these books are thoroughly entertaining. In the first installment we meet Alec and Jaya who run into each other in an elevator when she is at the lowest point in her life. Before the end of the story Alec will take her to several high points! The chemistry between the two characters is very hot and a fantastic beginning for the series. The next book continues the story right where the previous book ended. This allows the reader to continue to live in the stilettos world even if it is just a fantasy. Speaking of fantasies, this is exactly what the next couple Beckett and Ricci create. It does not hurt that Beckett has the look of every woman's fantasy. This couple takes us around the world in 80 days with races, harems and fantasies too hot for a review. The final book includes Micca and Caleb. This book reminds the reader that we all have a past and may need help healing. Caleb's love for Micca has led him to a revelation that he will not wait any longer for Micca and the way he earns her trust and her body leaves the rest of us jealous! These books are well worth the price and I strongly recommend reading them with a cool drink in a hot bubble bath!	2013-08-21

Holywood Star has turned out to be one of the best Rock autobiographies I've ever had the good fortune to stumble over. It stands in the same league with Diary of a Rock-n-Roll Star, the Dirt, and Full Moon - I kid you not. The writing is laugh-so-hard-you-wake-the-spouse-and-scare-the-pets hilarious. I read in bed while my husband sleeps and there were many times I had to clap my hand over my mouth to keep from shrieking out loud at some of the anecdotes. How Eamonn Nancarrow managed to live the full-on Rock and Roll experience and manage to keep all of his limbs, I don't know. From hard partying, to run-ins with skinheads, to brushes with sectarian violence, he somehow lived to tell the tale, and I'm so glad he did. The best and the worst of human nature is here, captured in 350 pages of brutally honest, Father Ted-meets-Spinal Tap awesomeness. This one will be a keeper on my Kindle for a long time to come.	2013-08-12

I always calculate the years and they didnt match. There were to much details that i found myself skipping pages just way to much. Also Sophie never showed any remorse for what she did that just ticked me off even with her past. Also Emily never told James she loved him unless that was one of the parts i skipped but he said it in the end. The end felt rushed. So i have this book a three star rating.

There is a difference in behavior between a 14 year old and an 18 year old so I couldn't really figure her out in certain situations.<br /><br />Rootu was getting on my nerves quickly. Everything seemed a game for him and was getting Esa in trouble because of it. And I hated how he could influence her mind to submit to his wishes. That's why I had trouble understanding some of Esa's actions because I didn't know the reason why she was doing it. She all of a sudden felt the need to help and protect Rootu even though she knew him only days. Was it some kind of connection she felt or was he influencing her mind? It was these little details that somewhat irritated me.<br /><br />The novel is beautifully written and it flows effortlessly. The characters are well presented and you can easily get a taste of their personality. I was annoyed by the constant conflict in Esa though where she felt a warning but kept doing things anyway which kind of felt like it was against her character as she was described as a child of the streets that is only looking to survive the day. And I didn't really get a feel of this post-apocalyptic world. If it wasn't for a couple of random mentions of it, I could easily place the story in some fantasy world that has nothing to do with post-apocalypse.	2013-08-01

I thought that a lot of the background took away from the overall story. But the murders were spot-on (more than made up for the negatives produced in the novel). Nothing different than any of the other readers put into their reviews (too long at parts, characters were seldom mentioned making the twist ending less of a twist). The one problem I had was with Tam. This child being 6 years old really got to me. Thinking realistically, I can't 100% believe that a 6yr old would do and think half the things that this boy did. It really bothered me and took away from the story. Maybe I'm being nit-picky and maybe the movie will show me the errors of my thoughts.<br />Anywho, it is a good book with plenty of blood and gore and unique kills, the antagonist is just crazy enough to make interesting. Eager to see how Parker can learn from his mistakes and produce a sequel.	2013-07-30

For that reason, he applies for the job of lighthouse keeper at remote Janus Island in Western Australia, situated where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet. He'll have plenty of time to ponder and may help save ships from being wrecked. Little does he know he'll soon find himself in a horrible position in which causing happiness for one woman will result in unspeakable grief for another, and vice versa.<br /><br />Allowing his beloved wife, Isabel, to keep the child she deeply loves, and who seemed to be washed to their shore by providence means sentencing the baby's birth mother, Hannah, to a lonely life of heartache and forever unanswered questions.<br /><br />Although my heart ached for each of the three adults, I grieved most for little Lucy. When I was little, I used to dread being taken away from my parents, who meant stability and all the world to me. Her confusion and pain was heartbreaking to read. Is this story about the eventual resilience of the human spirit, or would being the subject of this horrific predicament have scarred her for the long term more than the end of the book seems to indicate? I really don't know.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert<br /><br />I guess some readers may call the ending 'realistic' and others may say that it constitutes a 'literary' rather than 'popular' ending. Still, I would've liked it if twenty years hadn't lapsed before any contact was made. It seemed like a final cruel twist that Lucy eventually showed up one week after Isabel's death. It is definitely a book to help readers treasure those sweet, monotonous times with our own children.	2013-07-27

Gallagher, who is a life coach and yoga instructor, shares her method of reconnecting with yourself and mapping a plan to achieve your goals. Full of step-by-step instructions, Yen Path guides the reader through visualizing your dreams and desires to setting up an action plan and everything in between. Charts and worksheets are easy to use and really encourage the reader to take proactive steps rather than just absorbing the author's instructions.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed the overall concept and approach, the book was slow moving and seemed disjointed in places. Gallagher certainly knows and believes in her method, however, it seemed at times that she was overwhelmed by the amount of useful information she wanted to share. The author spent quite a lot of time preparing the reader for what was to come instead of just digging in to the information. Also, some life examples seemed rather large to take on for a general life/self-help book. For example, in a section titled \\\\\"Reconciling Conflict Inputs\\\\\", Gallagher provides the example of an individual who has a job and a family but wishes to quit his job to travel. \\\\\"You know that if you tell your wife about your plan, then she will be angry. Now you begin to feel resentment...\\\\\" Gallagher suggests, however, her remedy is to \\\\\"think differently\\\\\" and the \\\\\"clear the mental clutter\\\\\" using meditation.<br /><br />Overall, Yen Path is helpful when taken lightly. It's a nice reminder to focus on the big picture or big life goals and to be present in your life, to keep your values in mind and to let them guide your actions and beliefs. The worksheets were fun to do and were a nice exercise in visualizing goals and what is important."	2013-07-21

Got it when it was FREE which was the better price for this short read.<br /><br />So Taj and Angelina father conspired to work out a MOC b/w Taj and Angelina.  She knew nothing about it, but she did not want to marry him under those terms even though she was in lust, love, w/ him.  Angelina runs in to Taj where she is working as a nanny.  He can't believe she gave up all to be a nanny.  Angelina decided self- respect was priceless and she wanted it.  Angelina thought Taj had loved her but apparently he loved a merger more.  He is honest about what he truly wanted.  Angelina thinks perhaps she can play a game w/ their lust and finally achieve what she didn't get three years ago.  Taj seems all for it too.  After all he had suffered when she walked.  So while she appears harder than she was before he can't, but does w/ Angelina.  She uses him then leaves.  Forced to marry and learn that he would have replaced her as his wife pretty easily before, yet he hadn't.  She doesn't always give in to him easily, but he soon realizes that he does care for her.  He soon works out his problems, decides to set her free, but confesses love along the way.  It was nice that Taj hadn't been w/ any other women those three years.  He did feel something for her he just didn't know what it was at the time.  It was a nice, short story.	2013-07-18

I was 6 years old when it first came upon the scene. I read and re-read it and loved it every time I read it, which was often for about 30 years. Life came along and I stopped reading it for over 40 years. I just got the Kindle edition and settled in to visit and enjoy an old and dear friend.<br />What had I been thinking? Where had my sense of right and wrong been? How could I ever have been so shallow? so insensitive?<br />The book of my youth, that I quoted and encouraged anyone who had never read it to read, I know now, is a virulent, racist screed, tucked away in massive doses in what is actually, actually, a fascinating and riveting story.<br />If I were given to book-burning, which I am not, this horror would be the first on the bonfire. I'm trying to do a major mea culpa and tell all of the nieces, friends, casual acquaintances I have, over the years encouraged, even almost insisted, they read.<br />I am still shaking my head over how easily I skipped over, ignored, just didn't react to what is among the ugliest racism in print in the 20th century. I'm not discouraging people from reading GWTW.  The younger among us could see how our country's attitudes have changed since this book was and still is acclaimed, the Treyvon Martin trial fiasco being, hopefully, the anomaly I hope it to be.<br />To be a little more specific, Scarlett's beloved Mammy is referred to twice as having ape-like expressions on her face...yes, \\\\\"ape\\\\\" is the word of Mitchell's choice, not Scarlett's........remember, this was written in the 1930s, not the 1860s....and so it goes on and on, in all its racist poison....."	2013-07-16

She is the ultimate! Her parents knew she was talented and her career took off by the time she was 15. She has recorded 4 albums and is already on her way to setting records in the business. She felt like she wanted to go and finish school in person. So she tells everyone she wants to experience her senior year. Well that doesn't go over so good but at 19 she can do what she wants. So she tells her Manager Dad to kiss off and she leaves for Hope, Florida. She has a home there and within a week she is on her way to NORMAL.<br /><br />Well Scarlett Ryan is a millionaire rock star who is known all over. It's a very interesting take in school and how she sees the people who are now her peers. Some recognize her but some are confused and don't think it is her, the star. The first people she meets are half-brothers Stephan and Ethan. I love Stephan Montgomery. He's a little full of himself and is not intimidated by Scarlett. He teases her calling her Blondie, but you can see he is not as tough as he appears. She can't stop thinking about him or the fact that she never really had a boyfriend. Their relationship is cute and you WILL enjoy it.<br /><br />What I loved was that the message get a diploma. Then I loved how grounded she was. She realizes that she has screwed up, not giving things away, but she uses it as a learning experience. I appreciate that the author doesn't make it a story of excess. It is about a true talent, musical genius. What are you waiting for? go read it!	2013-06-05

The good<br />-first part of the book is ok, interesting magical system<br />-characters are cliched but appealing<br /><br />The bad<br />-the entire second half has such huge holes in the plot that even hardened pulp sci fi lovers such as my wife and i found it impossible to maintain the suspension of disbelief.<br />-fantasy world created, while interesting in the first half, falls apart completely by the second half. As soon as the narrative scope pulls back from the village where it starts, the writer is unable to create a bigger political and social structure that is in any way coherent. I'm not asking for Ursula LeGuin, but this book lacks even the usual standard fantasy empire.<br />- many many errors in spelling and some in grammar.<br /><br />Sigh. We wanted to like this book, but couldn't.	2013-06-03

"Thank you to the author for providing me this book.<br /><br />4 stars. (I liked it).<br /><br />Alpha girl tells us a story of werewolves. I liked the way the concept of werewolves returned to the old roots where being bitten by one, makes you one too, and you don't transform at will, but only once a month.<br /><br />Alpha girl left me with mixed feelings. For instance it had a lot of potential but somehow I was disappointed with some things. Still, it is rather refreshing in the genre, which I appreciate.<br />Things I liked:<br />- The writing is not tiring and it is easy to read.<br />- \\\\\"Taboo\\\\\" theme teacher x student.<br />- Hero does not sparkle, is not a depressed Greek god, it's an older guy and he's not stupidly rich.<br />- Heroine was a loner with \\\\\"friends\\\\\" and was able to interact with them.<br />- Heroine´s relationship with her parents. It was love-hate and I could identify myself with her feelings.<br />- The worries of the hero, which reflects the way society sees a romantic relationship between adult-teenager.<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />- The overuse of Mr.Stone´s nicknames to the heroine \\\\\"sweet, love\\\\\" etc. It felt so right at first, but so lame at the end. It made me feel like he was her daddy.<br />- How easily one character forgave the other after the major twist was revealed. I was expecting more angst and fight.<br />- How Rose started as an amazing mature girl and slowly became a complete brat.<br />- The feeling that being the \\\\\"alpha\\\\\" is not good, it makes the relationship seem forced between mates, in which one cannot \\\\\"disobey\\\\\".<br /><br />The plot was not completely original, but it was not cliché either, so I praise the author for it. I see a lot of potential to be developed in a sequel. I'm expecting an amazing sequel."	2013-05-24

I expected to be swept off my feet, bawl my eyes out and just feel like my heart was ripped out of my chest... none of that happened. Now let me explain...<br /><br />I loved the main character Parker. I thought she was one of the most realistic and raw characters I have seen in a book in quite some time. Her emotions and actions were just so true for that time in her life. She was irrational at times but it led her to a good place and the struggle she had with finding herself I think is something that a lot of people will relate to. The coming of age aspect of this novel was done exceptionally well. I also really enjoyed her best friend, Kat. Their relationship was done very well in my opinion. Kat had such honest emotions with the fact that Parker would be leaving for university and she would be remaining in town. The friendship between Parker and Kat was probably one of my favorite things about Golden.<br /><br />The plot, for me, was so predictable. I just seen everything that was going to happen coming well before it did. I'm not sure why... and I'm not sure if I was supposed to but it really kept me from loving the story. I obviously won't go into the details because these are major plot points that we are talking about but... ah, it frustrates me that I wasn't surprised. The story about Julianna and Shane is just heart wrenching. It's a really, really sad part of the book. I didn't openly cry but I felt this ache in my chest the more Parker read Julianna's diary. To think that someone so young had her fire snuffed out... oh, it's just so sad.<br /><br />My other love for Golden was the writing. I adore Jessi Kirby's writing style. She brings you entirely into the story and carries you along with it. It's like music. Between her writing and the characters Golden was saved for me.<br /><br />Now don't mistake that this isn't a wonderful story, it is. And I did like it but I think my high expectations crushed this one for me, which is unfortunate. I wanted to love this. It's well worth the read, especially if you love contemporary. And believe me ... there are a ton of AMAZING reviews for this. Take mine with a grain of salt.	2013-05-20

This book is such an important dissection of such a tragic time in history. This book takes place in Forrest Town, Arkansas in the late 60's, when segregation \\\\\"should\\\\\" have been on its way out, but was still holding its ugly roots in some areas of the south in particular.<br /><br />This unique and lovely story is positioned so well from Alison's point of view -- a simple farm-girl who graduates high school and is about to marry her high school sweet heart when a devastating event jars her conscious and causes her to really open her eyes and see how African Americans were being treated in her small town by her \\\\\"people.\\\\\" Having been raised in an environment of racial prejudice, in a town that has no intention of accepting the civil rights of all people, Alison is forced to decide between the love of her old-school father and accepting her \\\\\"place\\\\\" (as well as to stand beside her fianc&eacute;, Jimmy Lee, who has a few dark secrets she's beginning to suspect) OR to stand up for what she's beginning to believe in - that people shouldn't be treated differently based on the color of their skin.<br /><br />What makes this book stand apart from other books about this topic, is just the pure beauty and flow of Foster's language. The book has a beautiful, southern cadence and a simple, clean way of story-telling. From page one I was drawn into Alison's character and could see her as she took those fateful steps. My heart ached for her when she was put in horrifying situations that she wanted to take back and felt shame for bearing witness to. You could literally feel her heart aching from being torn by what she knows from how she's been raised, and what she knows to be true based on what her heart is telling her. And Foster has a wonderful gift with her turn-of-phrase, and had some lines that just left me speechless they were so wonderfully written.<br /><br />Enter Jackson. Swoon worthy, sweet, strong, handsome, kind-hearted, well-mannered, charming Jackson. It's not a spoiler to say that the other side of this story, woven beautifully with Alison's personal growth in regards to fighting for civil liberty, is the love story that blossoms slowly, and beautifully, and heart-breakingly between her and Jackson. You want so much for them to have a happy ending right away, without going through the real life tribulations that are bound to happen with a forbidden love in a racially charged town where citizens are taking the law into their own hands for the \\\\\"safety\\\\\" of the streets against \\\\\"those people.\\\\\" I was hanging onto every word, aching with Alison as doors seemed to close for her. Rooting when she started to grow up and away from the beliefs she was raised on. And cheered when she began listening to her heart and trying to change status quo for future generations. And sobbed when she let Jackson walk away from her after a conversation at one point early on in the book. (This was me: \\\\\"Noooo! Run after him you idiot!\\\\\")<br /><br />Equally as deep and beautiful in this book is Alison's relationship with her mother. Watching it unfold the way it did was such a privilege. I loved a line she said about learning more about her mother in those five minutes than she had in eighteen years of living with her. Simply beautiful. And her sister, Maggie, was such a strong and memorable character as well. Foster just has a way of making you fall deeply entrenched in your passion for the character's plight and being emotionally invested in their outcomes.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the ending, but Foster did a wonderful job portraying the reality of the situation, and that is - things don't change overnight. Not when there is hate born on generations of discrimination that run through a town. But, my oh my, the courage these people showed to be a part of history, do the right thing, and affect change - it was simply breathtaking to bear witness to.<br /><br />Andnot ever can I recall an interracial couple who will live on as a most beloved romantic couple whose epic love story will never be forgotten by readers. But for me, this is a couple whose love story I will celebrate for a very long time. It's just one of those stories where you get done reading and you think, damn! I wish these characters were real. I want to be friends with Maggie. I want to sit down and talk with Alison and Jackson. I want to see Jimmy Lee go down in flames. This was one villain I can't say I felt any love for (and I kinda like a good villain).<br /><br />This was easily one of the best books I've read in a very, very long time. And Alison and Jackson's story will always hold a place in my heart. I hope you enjoy it every bit as much as I did.<br /><br />Oh, and I read it in both versions (with southern dialect in the narrative and without) and I can honestly say I LOVED both versions equally.ver can I recall an interracial couple who will live on as a most beloved romantic couple whose epic love story will never be forgotten by readers.

Plenty of themes and backdrops are familiar (in particular, I've had enough meth-fueled characters and situations to last me a good while). For me, though, the standout attribute of this collection is the way it alternated from grimness to a warped levity. No clinkers here, and though there are many standouts, the entries that come to mind right now are those from Garnett Elliott, Tom Pitts, Jim Wilsky, and McDroll. I'd say I was familiar with about half the authors here, and so it's good to have exposure to so many other new ones."	2013-04-10

Here we have a smart, independent heroine who isn't a Mary Sue, a hero who is introspective and honorable without being in any way boring, and an aphrodisiac that actually works--overwhelmingly and on everyone who encounters it--and the heroine's quest to keep it safe and NOT use it.<br /><br />Yeah, you weren't expecting that, were you?<br /><br />It's that last bit that makes Powder of Sin so unique and riveting. Instead of selling the drug to the highest bidder or using it to entrap Gideon who she desires more every day, Rosalie seeks to protect society from the harm it could cause. Gideon, who is rather like the male version of a lady's nurse/chaperone for a man who makes the most outrageous rake you've ever imagined seem tame, joins in to help her because the worst thing he can imagine is the powder falling into his charge's possession. No female under the age of 101 would be safe!<br /><br />Kate Rothwell is one of my favorite authors and this story is an excellent example why. Her characters are realistic and compelling, her knowledge of the historical period is flawless, and the combination of humor, drama, and heat is just right. I can't recommend this book enough!	2013-03-26

John Medina has put his finger on many many aspects of learning that were not even contemplated when public education was first introduced.  Sadly, the founding model of public education has so thoroughly permeated it, that almost none of the modern discoveries about learning can be implemented in a meaningful way.  Even modern digital and communication technologies are being used like adding digital gages, GPS, and entertainment systems to horse drawn buggies.  As Medina says, the education system must be changed in a revolutionary way if we are to remedy its failings.  30% dropout rates, a scientifically illiterate public, college graduates who have no useful knowledge of our country's history, 17th and lower placement of our very best students vs the rest of the world...These are unacceptable results from our nation's education system.	2013-03-10

There’s a threesome scene that our heroine witnesses that was pretty hot and the chemistry between Masi and Lex is tangible.  However, I found myself more invested in the storyline than the romance.  The people around Lex and Masi were fun and compelling, and I really liked Lex herself for the most part, but it took me a while to warm up to Masi because he seemed a strange combination of gentleman and jerk.<br /><br />I wasn’t wholly invested in the story, but even so, I have to admit that when things got critical I was crying for Lex and wanting to scream at Masi for being a little naïve in such a situation.  However, the ending was sweet and adorable and I came out firmly on the approving side for Masi.<br /><br />Overall, while the sex was hot, it was regarded much too casually for the majority of the book and the plot was pretty predictable.  While I ultimately enjoyed the book, it just didn’t captivate me.<br /><br />A fast, easy read, Undressed is a very steamy read with fun characters and an interesting fashion scene.  If you’re looking for a pretty light hearted romance with a little kink, don’t miss this one.<br /><br />**I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.**	2013-03-09

This page turner was no excpetion.<br /><br />I'm not too sure why they all have to be struggling legal aid lawyers to start off with but nevertheless, the plot is good and the pages keep turning quite fast. Benigno writes well and keeps you intriqued from page one. If I had to look for fault it might be that one had to concentrate in order to decipher the real case or the main plot amongst the fillers.<br /><br />The formula works, a struggling lawyer, a little romance and some life threatening situations. In this case add a father in law...a break-up and make-up and even an organsied crime boss and you have it all. No this isn't up there with the best but it still makes a good read and the kindle versions offers very good value for money with this book.	2013-02-04

I really enjoyed this short book, reading it in a couple of sittings.<br /><br />It's clear the author really knows and enjoys his craft, and makes the process of setting up as a photographer seem almost straightforward and even fun. The book is well-organized, and there's a wealth of information here, with informative headings including:<br /><br />-Dispelling Myths: You do not need expensive equipment to get started.<br />-What sort of photography should you pursue?<br />-Marketing Your Services: Create local partnerships with existing businesses.<br />-Pricing Your Services.<br />-Expanding Your Business..<br /><br />The book is part just the facts listing of steps to building your own photography business, and part encouraging account of the author's journey from teen with a new camera to professional photographer.<br /><br />The admonitions that it doesn't take too much money to start the business, and there is always room for another photographer, may seem disingenuous to some, what with today's economic climate and the plethora of expensive gadgets waiting to tempt novice and professional alike, but the basis is true. For each type and level of photographer, there is a different clientele, and one need only go as fast or as far as seems comfortable.<br /><br />Good advice, plainly spoken, with enough detail to enable the enthusiast to carry on alone and build a good foundation.	2013-01-23

The first half was good but I kept waiting patiently for something to happen, someone to make a move, some action if you will, so in a good way, it kept my interest, but in a bad way, I was like come on already lol. After the halfway point things started to happen and it got a little intense and somewhat sexy, then there was some suspense thrown in about 75% of the way through and it made me get antsy and want to finish the story.<br /><br />Scandalous is an appropriate title for this story where preacher meets painter.<br /><br />Abby and Jack knew each other in high school but when something happens that makes Abby run away she does just that and decides to become a preacher. Ten years or so later she has gotten herself in some hot water and is kicked out for a year. She has nothing, no money to amount to anything, no food and the only thing she does have is her friend, Kate. She ends up staying with her and has to find a job that can help her as well as pay off her outrageous debts.<br />Abby decides that she will interview at a gallery only to discover the painter that is known as Jonathan Gray is actually Jack from all those years ago.<br /><br />Mesmerized by his paintings and of course him, she realizes that those long ago feelings are still there and she doesn't know what to do. Jack decides to offer her the job and so she hesitantly accepts. Their friendship is rekindled and she confides in him.<br /><br />I got frustrated here because you could see the torment they were putting themselves through and the intensity of their feelings that neither one would act on until.....<br /><br />The suggestion, his idea, was the beginning and the end. It consumed me in ways I couldn't have imagined. The idea was like Jack in every way-completely tempting and completely forbidden.<br /><br />I really liked Jack and once I got to know him I adored him and in the end he made me mad but it all worked out. It was a quick read and it could have been longer. Some things seem to be rushed and there was no angsty buildup in my opinion.<br /><br />With all of the above being said do I think you should read it? The answer is yes especially if you like art. I personally had a hard time connecting with the characters but that doesn't mean you won't. It obviously held my interest with a variety of things that happened and a few I didn't see coming which made it a plus for me. So my review again is just my opinion and my opinion only. Always keep in mind that what interests one may not interest another. Happy reading :0)I got to know him I adored him and in the end he made me mad but it all worked out.

My husband waited so long for this book and was extremely disappointed. For some reason, the author to a different route with his writing style and it just didn't seem to work. The first two books of this series are written as the main character's journal. You got to read day by day what was happening, his thoughts, his ideas and it was like being in his head. This book, which is supposed to be the last of 3 has three different stories going and is written as if narrated by someone else. This series was so unique because of the original writing style and the plausible story line, but my hubby said he is having trouble pushing through the book, especially after the alien story line started. Very disappointed. I leaves you feeling cheated after the long wait.	2013-01-20
