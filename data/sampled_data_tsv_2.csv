Two faith paths have diverged over many centuries, split on the recognition of Jesus as Messiah.  Jews worship G-d, Christians worship Jesus.  Jews are immersed in a highly disciplined community, a dutiful, vibrant fellowship true to the Torah well into its third millennium.  Practice is to Jews what belief is to Christians.  Jewish faith everywhere has been sorely tested by anti-Semitism, and that has created a highly resilient, highly intellectual, highly adaptable expression.  Jews derive great coherence and compassion from their rituals.<br />This is a very comfortable, non-technical, leisurely story of how Lauren has inhabited two different faiths, both of which she respects.	2012-12-23

With this book, I was equally captivated but also slightly disappointed. I throughly enjoyed the book despite its shortcomings, which is why I gave it as many stars as I did. Psion Delta launches into a scenario that is obviously leading to a minor plot twist and I was kind of disappointed with the apparent lack of effort to deceive or suprise the reader in any way. Even the biggest plot twist in the story was foreshadowed over and over and even in the previous book. In addition, I feel the author reuses plot pieces from the previous books. Despite this, Delta does still feel original and was an amusing read.	2012-12-14

More people then there should be keep going missing and Haven is a town full of secrets and monsters, but then Anna has secrets of her own...<br /><br />Young Adult books and me aren't the best of buds, they sit there looking all pretty on the shelf and I admit I sneer \\\\\"Just one more Twilight rip off; as if the first one wasn't bad enough,\\\\\" but I decided to give The Better to Bite a chance and I refuse to believe this was because I was enticed by the pretty cover (I probably was). Now that I have finished it, I am glad I gave this book a chance, although it may not be something that I would usually read, I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />Although I did like it, it did take a while for it to warm up for me and it took me a while to warm up to Anna, I admit at first she irritated me; however, like a rash she grew on me. What kept me hooked on The Better to Bite was the mystery of the town of Haven, although some parts weren't exactly a mystery I still found the story behind the town interesting and the mystery of Anna's mother will keep me reading to the next book.<br /><br />But, as this is a YA  of course there is the much used and abused love triangle between Anna and two hot guys from her school each with a secret of their own, their is Brent of the All American good lucks and seemingly nice guy and Rafe the dark haired and dangerous bad boy, I am team Rafe all the way. I hope Eden doesn't stretch the love triangle to the max and Anna choose (Rafe) quickly.<br /><br />This book has really surprised me and although I am not a YA convert, I will grab the next book in this series, once it got going it was fast paced and had teenage characters that I didn't want to punch in the face, WIN!<br /><br />*Review copy provided by authorh I am not a YA convert, I will grab the next book in this series, once it got going it was fast paced and had teenage characters that I didn't want to punch in the face, WIN!<br /><br />*Review copy provided by author"	2012-12-04

[[ASIN:B008C84HH4 Lucretia and the Kroons (Kindle Single)]] is a novella with all the punch of a full-length novel.  It's not often that authors write about children dealing with their friends' deaths, but Victor LaValle is not afraid.<br /><br />Lucretia's best friend, Sunny, suffers from an illness (probably cancer) that has slowly taken her away from her friend.  Treatment and medication have rendered her almost unrecognizable, but still Lucretia remains faithful.  Then comes the day when Sunny disappears and Lucretia finds herself on a mad and frightening and marvelous adventure into the unknown with only a mysterious and monstrous woman as her guide.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book.  It was sweet and genuine and scared the pants off of me.  Mr. LaValle has a great way with words and storytelling and opens a big picture window for his readers and characters to step through.  Wonderful read and appropriate for middle grade kids and all of us older kids who aren't easily frightened or just love to be scared!	2012-12-03

I actually read Ms Bast's other novel, Werewolf Bound, first and loved it so I was excited to read this one too. I wasn't disappointed at all. It's not your normal werewolf book. Amber is special--she has abilities that most werewolves don't possess. No Remorse is written in third person omniscient, so we get to see a lot of the different characters POVs without switching scenes, which is sometimes hard for me to follow, but I still enjoyed the story very much. I can't wait to read some of Ms. Bast's novels, including her new young adult, Realm of Secrets, another Heart of a Wolf novel, Shadoh's Tale. This book was given to me by the author for an honest review.	2012-12-01

This is something even better.<br /><br />I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I started this, but it held me spellbound from start to finish.

And I absolutely loved it!<br />I would recommend listening to Niyaz while reading this - for me it was a match made in heaven, especially \\\\\"Dunya\\\\\" and \\\\\"Iman\\\\\" - they made the one so-called sex scene so surreal I couldn't even blink while reading it.

The first time I just plowed through in one sitting and thought it was just okay. I really liked the concept and knew there was a whole series of Mercury books that all sounded interesting so I read it again only slower and then I thought it was genius. It is funny but if you pay attention and don't just blaze through it you will catch subtle miscommunications between characters and nuanced dialogue that will be buried and almost hidden in the text that will be very humorous. There are characters in the background doing things while main characters are talking that will make you laugh. It draws its influence from Douglas Adams to be sure and is remaniscant of Terry Pratchett and Monty Python. It is satirecal and irreverent, clever and funny, and yes just a little bit insightful. I am looking forward to the whole series.	2012-11-16

"This third installment of the \\\\\"Sole Regret\\\\\" Series is the best so far. The quality of this series just keeps getting better and better, mind you, it started out very good but it keeps improving at an unexpected pace.<br />Olivia Cunning is a master of the Rockstar fantasy, creating the perfect scenarios, characters, dialogues and passions. She certainly has a way with words that never fall flat, bringing to life the fantasies of a rock fan.<br /><br />We've come to know all the members of the band \\\\\"Sole Regret\\\\\" through the first two stories, but now we get to really meet in depth the vocalist Shade, I mean, Jacob. Like two sides of the same coin, our hero has two names, stage and life. Always hiding behind dark glasses, Shade is \\\\\"never going to fall, but never hard to catch\\\\\" like My Darkest Days sings it. So, your average jerk.<br />Jacob... well, he's a complete different story, isn't he?<br /><br />I don't want to reveal any more about the characters or their story. This novella is just such a treat that everybody deserves to dive in as freshly as possible and thoroughly enjoy it as I have.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this book is that ended way too soon although the story is not over. The author can do a lot with the premises set here. I would encourage her to keep exploring and write a full book.<br /><br />This story could go so many ways from the point it finishes... I wonder how everything would develop on the long run for all the parts involved. Yes, this is the intensity of the story, it grips you and doesn't let go even after you've finished reading.<br /><br />Remarks:<br />- Engaging characters<br />- Steaming hot erotic scenes<br />- Recommended soundtrack by the author: \\\\\"Angel\\\\\" & \\\\\"I don't wanna miss a thing\\\\\" by Aerosmith, \\\\\"Walking on Sunshine\\\\\" by Katrina and the Waves.<br /><br />Although this is a review of the 3rd book I highly encourage everybody to read the first two books too. Not only they are very affordable, they are incredible good as well.l."	2012-10-28

These roles enable her to see the bigger picture; she knows which foods are healthy for you, and she understands the factors that influence availability and affordability of fresh, nutritious fare. One of the key points Steinmetz makes is that what's available is determined by what we choose to eat: every forkful that's consumed influences our future food supply. She emphasizes that we have that kind of power, and it's time to claim it.<br /><br />Why should we care about eating local? The author points out that our current food choices are leading to obesity, pollution from pesticides and other agricultural chemicals, overly processed foods lacking nutritional value, and other problems. By being conscientious of our food consumption, we can start to reduce the incidence and extent of these issues.<br /><br />Not only is \\\\\"Eat Local\\\\\" an informative read, it's also an enjoyable one. Steinmetz writes with both authority and passion, analyzing local food from all angles to provide the reader with a complete big picture. She also encourages readers to celebrate local food and all its glory, from culture and community to variety and biodiversity. The information is presented nicely, with Q&A sections and summaries to break up the material into smaller, bite-size portions.<br /><br />Everyone can take away something from this book. Whether or not you cook, and whether or not you grow a garden, you will learn how to make better food choices and how to help the next generation do the same. \\\\\"Eat Local\\\\\" is a book you'll want to keep in the kitchen and refer to again and again."	2012-10-07

I guess it's just me, but here's what I found:<br /><br />* The cover is cool!<br />* The storyline is promising!<br />* The writing is contrived!<br />* Moments of clarity and then flashes of confusion!<br /><br />I'm convinced that it's just me.<br />After all, the elements that the book describes are there: espionage, politics, deceit and romance.  Yet, much of the time I felt like I was listening to the story under water; as in a foggy disjointed state. Some things I just didn't get. I didn't understand David and Alice's relationship. I didn't understand David and Odette's relationship. I didn't understand David and Zoe's relationship (when did she become the wife???). I didn't understand David and Taz's relationship. Things/events happened too fast or not fast enough for my taste. Again, it's just me. I wanted to love this story. I certainly loved the title. And the cover made me feel, I don't know, like Astaire was dancing (you know, like the story would be graceful, intriguing and don't-want-to-put-it-down kinda of feeling).  While I read it straight through, I found myself talking out loud (i.e., how can police officers be so trusting/inept, just plain dumb?). There are usages of *crisp* language that one would find in that sort of world but for me, they seemed out of place at times and used for shock value rather than for emphasis. And, this is coming from a woman who finds justification in using a few choice 4 letter words a time or two.  But then, I found Malphurs's writing forced in those places, not natural, not flowing. All that said, I liked Frederick Malphurs's concept and think with the aid of a copy editor, he would be fantastic. But that's just me, I reckon ~!~.	2012-09-21

Most authors would either start a new chapter, put a string of anything meaningless in the way to show that the scene had changed, or even left three lines or so of space. Not here.

Integrity is important to me and gushing false reviews do neither author or reader any favours. As always my views are what I honestly feel about this book.<br />Caitlyn is a TV news reporter hoping to build up her career. Magic isn't real she believes so when she's offered the chance to stay at the home of star illusionist Shay Evers she jumps at the chance to see him in a different environment convinced she'll be able to pick up where he's faking it and expose him. However she hadn't factored in how she would feel about her growing attraction to him. Shay has his own secrets from her, he's in love with her and there's just two weeks left to break a curse bringing her death - but she has to go home to another realm to solve it and believe that magic is real. Its a tough order for him and his mysterious friend Rhys. As the story unfolds secrets become unravelled yet sometimes they just lead to even more confusion. Caitlyn faces danger from sources anxious to ensure she doesn't break the curse.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, it will appeal to adults and teens alike with its blend of magic and romance. Its fits well within the paranormal romance genre having a second \\\\\"realm\\\\\" where magic is normal linked to the conventional world. Most of the action takes place here in this world but we see enchanting glimpses of the other realm throughout the book. Its written in 3rd person POV and easy to follow. The descriptions of the magical enchanted events are simply beautiful and I could visualise the places so well. Caitlyns dresses especially were simply breathtaking in the way the were verbally drawn.<br /><br />The characters were well described visually but I seemed unable to fully empathise with them - I'm not sure why, maybe its just because I could \\\\\"see\\\\\" them but I couldn't really understand them - we didn't get enough about them as people, their hopes, fears, emotions etc. Shay appears as a lovely, caring, generous character, easy to fall in love with, but we don't really learn much about the other characters, his friend Rhys, Caitlyn - and as she's a main character we need to know her in depth, and her friend Marcy. Given that they were such close friends there was little interaction between Caitlyn and Marcy in Wales, and when there were accidents I'd have expected more concern for each other rather than the \\\\\"oh gosh you could have died!\\\\\" and then going off to do something unnecessary. If it was my friend I'd have wanted to be with them constantly.<br /><br /> The book ticks all my usual boxes for a five star, its fantasy/paranormal romance, a good length at 223 pages, well edited and pretty error free, good plots and dramatic events and excellent value at $5.99. There's a good mix of both text and dialogue to keep it interesting. If only I could have taken more to the characters and really cared about what happened to them I'd have given it five stars but somehow I felt too detached from them to get really involved. Maybe a bit more about them personally would have made it more lifelike for me - I have to feel \\\\\"part\\\\\" of the book to really enjoy and give five stars. This one gets four stars for the reasons I've written. I feel a bit bad for that as clearly the author has taken a lot of time and trouble over this book, and I'm sure other people will rate it higher.maybe its just because I could \\\\\"see\\\\\" them but I couldn't really understand them - we didn't get enough about them as people, their hopes, fears, emotions etc. Shay appears as a lovely, caring, generous character, easy to fall in love with, but we don't really learn much about the other characters, his friend Rhys, Caitlyn - and as she's a main character we need to know her in depth, and her friend Marcy.

I guess we gotta have that in this story, but so much? it did gross me out some.<br /><br />On Kindle, I counted about 50 religious swear words (Christ! etc.) Is that supposed to make the hero more macho? Believe me, Z is plenty tough. Is it supposed to fit the context? Nope, not with some Scribe Virgin goddess running around upstairs. Problem is, I can't relax fully into a story if I have to cringe repeatedly at the language. I'm fine with some regular cussing occasionally,  but not constant F-bombs and excess profanity.	2012-08-06

You may groan audibly at the prospect of yet more zombies but it's actually rather different. Pitched as a comedy horror by its creator, the comedy is black, but I found it much more serious than I'd expected, especially after the halfway point.<br /><br />It took me a little while to get into the book, I felt the opening was more slapstick than the rest of the story - I thought it was going to be some sort of bizarre \\\\\"good\\\\\" zombie love story at the outset, but boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Adam establishes the rules of his undead horde quickly - they are much like all the other zombies we know and love, but there's some brilliant, gory description to prop them up. There's also Fred, one of the primary protagonists who, as it happens, is a zombie himself.<br /><br />The difference between Fred, (45, pot belly and limp, bitten by clerk), is that he's a thinking zombie who remembers his past life. He also learns he can control other zombies. The problems, though, are evident. He has no hang-ups over eating brains like his brothers, he enjoys them as much as your next zombie. He's also falling apart and to top it off, he thinks he's fallen in love with Aleta, a \\\\\"breather\\\\\" (human, not zombie), with amazing eyes. Also, \\\\\"breathers\\\\\" are fewer and farther between so he's hungry and of late they appear to be fighting back; it's almost as if they're going to win the war.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about the initial spread of the virus immensely - George Potts the overly-friendly zombie postman and also scenes like Janet and the severely hen-pecked Stanley and also the penis incident. I did feel we were, at times, learning about slightly throwaway characters when we perhaps should have been concentrating more on the main players, but this changed as the story progressed and on the whole I thought the descent into madness and anarchy in the world of zombies was well played.<br /><br />We are also notably treated to Jon Tanner's evil descent (a truly mad bastard) and Timmy, a kid heading for what could possibly send the dead back to the grave and a reunion with his dad, who just happens to be a zombie.<br /><br />Overall I've Been Deader is a great, snappy read and suitably different from similar books. I look forward to what Adam Sifre will cook up next - by the looks of it, a prequel."	2012-07-18

Some of the things that make it stand out to me is the fact that on most pages the bottom half is just explanations and applications. I love that this Bible uses that space to give a background on the context and history of the time, and the different translations, as well as summarize the main points, explain the metaphors, and talk about different interpretations. I know the text has helped me get more out of reading the bible, it also emphasizes small but important details I otherwise would have missed.<br />I read (and highlight) a few sections every night before bed so that I go to sleep thinking of what I've learned and how I can incorporate lessons into my life, this bible is very helpful and I'd recommend everyone doing that.

She did, however, know the difference between fabulous fantastic Southern Cuisine and stuff like most of what Jane Westerfield includes in the pages of [[ASIN:B007DMN6G8 Southern Main Dishes & More! (Miss Scarlett's Scrumptious Southern Cooking)]].  Take \\\\\"Miss Jenna's Taco Chili\\\\\" as an example. (BTW, \\\\\"traditionally\\\\\" - since Jane seems to rely on that - Jenna as a daughter is not old enough to have earned the Miss title, unless the person addressing her is a servant.)  You'll have to imagine the Bold type and underlinings yourself.<br /><br />Chili:<br /><br />1 lb, Ground beef (I prefer Ground Round)<br />1 can WHOLE KERNEL corn, DRAINED<br />1 or 2 cans beans (your choice of Red, Kidney, etc.)<br />1 can Rotel tomatoes and green chilis<br />1 packet Ranch seasoning mix<br />1 packet chili seasoning mix<br />1/2 to 1 cup onions, diced<br /><br />Topping:<br />1 cup cheddar cheese, SHREDDED<br />1 bag of Fritos corn ships (sic) (REGULAR SMALL, NOT scoops)<br /><br />In LARGE saucepan or skillet, brown the ground beef.  Mix all CHILI ingredients together and heat thoroughly.  PLEASE NOTE: If using CROCKPOT, heat for 4 to 6 hours on HIGH setting. (That Please Note business is underlined in the book.  Grandma's further note:  when you are done cooking this on high, place the burned mess directly into the garbage disposal where it belongs.)  Serve and top with SHREDDED cheese and Fritos.<br /><br />Jane - do you think we are all DEAF?  What is with all the SHOUTING? And where did you ever get the idea that this monstrosity had anything whatever to do with Southern Cuisine?<br /><br />This one is the same as the last one:  Jane didn't bother to look at the Kindle, the ingredients are centered, there is too much bold and too much red so Jane has to SHOUT at us all the time, you cannot make recipe notes in a special place in a Kindle book, the Table of Contents is not interactive. OH, yes - one more thing.  The introduction is identical to the Introduction in her Side Dishes & Breads book.

James Hay<br /><br />My fellow reviewer, kindlefan \\\\\"indogirl 67\\\\\" is quite upset by the blatant racism in this novel.  Racism upsets me also; but the author was just using what was happening during that time period in that part of the United States. In actual fact, there were many, many cases of African American males being lynched (with or without a trial) for a number of crimes, not just murder. He was an easy scapegoat. This injustice continued up through the `30s and into the `40s - maybe longer.<br /><br />With that in mind, my major complaint is that the main character continually disregards clues which point away from his preconceived notion of who is the guilty party. Except for that, the plot was interesting. Character definition was well done. It was part of the story. But the flaw distracted my reading, rather than enhancing it.  I would not give this book a high recommendation.  Not sure whether I would read another novel by this author."	2012-03-02

I believe it used to have a different cover, one that shows up on the inside of the book.  Either that or it was posted elsewhere because I remember seeing this other cover and passing it up because it was very amateur looking which made me think the book probably was also.  I'm really glad the author changed the cover because I might not have given it a chance if not for the new cover.<br /><br />It does start with the main character Ellie in a thrift store trying on a wedding dress.  The action starts in that thrift store and is pretty consistent from there on out.<br /><br />What I liked about this book:<br />It wasn't your typical YA paranormal/fantasy characters.  Trolls! How cool.  Someone asked me are they the scary trolls or the Amanda Hocking type trolls.  I haven't read the Amanda Hocking troll books so I can't honestly make a comparison but I think there were a little of both in this book.<br /><br />I also liked that it wasn't your typical YA characters.  It wasn't the new kid in town drawn to the hottest boy in school or the hot new boy that shows up and is drawn to the dumpy/plain/shy girl that no one likes/pays attention to.  The character had deep roots in the town as did all the characters.<br /><br />The last thing that I really liked was that you weren't really sure who was the good guy or the bad guy and I wasn't entirely sure how things were going to pan out.<br /><br />There were of course little things of course that I could point out, but I won't because to be honest they were minimal and the story was very well written and for an Indie very well edited.  I usually prefer first person narration for my young adult novels but the author did such a wonderful job that I wasn't aware of the POV after the first couple of pages.  Plainly stated, the story had heart.<br /><br />My only complaint is, after I was finished with the book I wanted to know if there would be a sequel and totwitter/blog stalk the author as I do with many authors whose books I like, but I was unable to find anything except a bio on Authonomy.com.<br /><br />I would give this book 4.5 stars if any of the sites I'll be posting the review on had that option.  Since they don't I'm rounding it up to 5 stars because I was unable to finish the last two Indie books I attempted.  So, this book gets a bonus half star for not only being good enough to finish but good enough for me to really like.	2012-02-26

Lucy knew how to barter with the only thing she had, which I could understand given her situation, but the problem I had with this was that although her owner and dear friend Emma had educated her, Lucy lacked survival skills.  I mean if you have enough diamonds to buy a hotel (didn't have the sense to read the paperwork...), then buy yourself some weapons and hire a bodyguard.  I really got tired of Lucy running, screaming, cowering and asking questions for others to solve (she could have solved her problems if she had paused from having sex).	2011-10-08

How do the traumatic events of childhood shape the rest of our lives? What truths do we obscure? What lies do we tell, even to ourselves? These are the questions that arise again and again in this haunting, many-layered novel.    \\\\\"Freely moving back and forth between past and present, and between generations, Lippman's skillful narrative similarly reveals the truth one bit at a time...\\\\\"  During the fall of 1977, something unforgettable --- and perhaps unforgivable --- happened to a close-knit group of neighborhood children in a Baltimore suburb. These kids, from three different families and very different circumstances, sat on that vulnerable cusp between childhood and adolescence, when relationships change rapidly and friendships that used to seem innocent now appear anything but.    Those children are grown now, all but one --- Gordon (known as Go Go) --- who died in a horrific single-vehicle accident on the dead-end highway out of town. Go Go has struggled with alcohol use most of his adult life, and he's always been troubled, if not a little crazy. So no one knows whether it was a drunken accident or a deliberate self-inflicted death by automobile that killed him. Go Go's childhood friend Gwen, in town to care for her elderly father, is particularly troubled by Go Go's death, which brings back all sorts of other unanswered questions from that autumn more than 30 years earlier.    Gwen, who is using her father's illness as an excuse to flee her own failing marriage, has largely lost touch with the Halloran brothers, who were her closest companions back then. In fact, handsome Sean was her first serious boyfriend. She's even less connected to fascinating, slightly mysteriousbad girl Mickey, who has since reinvented herself as a beautiful flight attendant named McKey. But when they all come back to their small town for Go Go's funeral, it's hard not to recall those horrific events of their youth.    The only problem is that no one has the full story --- not the kids (now adults) and not their parents, who experienced their own fallout in the wake of the tragedy that defined their children's youth. Freely moving back and forth between past and present, and between generations, Lippman's skillful narrative similarly reveals the truth one bit at a time, ensuring that readers, like Gwen, won't want to stop until they find out the truth of what happened those many years ago. Memories may be fallible, and truths may be hidden, but the power of a compelling story shines through. In the novel, \\\\\"the most dangerous thing\\\\\" is truth that is neither seen nor understood. Her storytelling reviews that truth --- and far more besides.    --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"	2011-08-31

A quick look at the book cover seemed to confirm my first impression and so I almost passed it by. Then I saw the subtitle: MICHELLE RHEE TAKES ON THE NATION'S WORST SCHOOL DISTRICT. This book is ultimately about children, but it's no children's book, that's for sure.<br /><br />The book focuses on the efforts of Michelle Rhee, a young Korean-American college student, who decides to become a contracted elementary school teacher through the Teach for America program for a few years, until she decides what she really wants to do. Her first assignment is to a poor urban school in Baltimore where she quickly learns that teaching, even at the elementary school level, is much more difficult than she ever imagined it would be. Through her own dogged commitment and exceptional creativity, Rhee comes to realize that the students, their neighborhood environment and ethnicity are not to blame for the school's abysmal academic performance, even though that is the prevailing opinion of the teachers, administration, and teacher's union. &#34;It's the kids! They just don't want to learn.&#34;<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: There may be plot information beyond this point that some readers may not want to know. If so, stop now or continue reading at your own risk.<br /><br />According to Rhee, the condition of the entire D.C. school district was due to the lack of quality teachers and administrators who possess what she calls &#34;snap&#34; (a strong desire to improve themselves so they can adequately educate their students, preparing them for their futures). This launches Rhee into a career as an education reformer as well as the numerous political battles which result from her strict methodology.<br /><br />Michelle Rhee is hired in 2007 as district chancellor with a mandate from the mayor to reform and improve America's worst school district, Washington D.C. She uses her past teaching experiences, organizational skills, unflappable temperament and a belief that schools fail because of inadequate, low performing teachers and principals. Never one to back down from a challenge, Rhee fires the majority of the teachers and replaces them with new, trained and motivated teaches. She also closes and consolidates failing, under-populated schools. This bold move doesn't endear her to a large part of the community, the city council, nor the Washington Post. But the measurable and demonstrated academic improvements are undeniable. Predictably, the atmosphere becomes politically charged rather than educationally motivating.<br /><br />In the 2010 mayoral election, the mayor who had staked his political life on dramatic improvement in the D.C. schools is defeated and Rhee leaves. But the reforms begun by Michelle Rhee continue, albeit with a less publicly visible and dramatic chancellor at the helm. The ideals installed by Michelle Rhee are still there: An emphasis on teacher quality, retention based on performance rather than tenure, a performance-based salary system and a strong emphasis on recruiting new teachers who view teaching as more than just a job.<br /><br />In his final interview with Rhee, the author asked her what was the legacy of her term in the D.C. Public Schools. She replied that through &#34;IMPAC [her teacher evaluation system], we would have removed the lowest performers and professionally developed those who need to improve their practice. As a result of those two things--rewarding the best and moving the others up or out--four years from now we would have one of the strongest teaching forces of an urban district.&#34; After reading this engaging and informative book, I have little doubt this may have happened.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I think about the author's involvement in this unauthorized biography. At times he seemed too easily swayed toward complete agreement with what Rhee and her group was doing. Considering the complexity of the problems in D.C., it would seem a more critical eye would have been appropriate and expected. There were a few times when Whitmire did focus a mildly critical eye on some of Rhee's failures, although these critical moments were definitely few and far between. I think it was in his summary at the end of the book when he was most critical, mostly, I think, because it was Rhee's mistakes that had led to her early departure from the school district.<br /><br />I'm sure there are others who would disagree with Rhee's plan and actions, but this book (and my review) is about Michelle Rhee and not all the other possibilities that could have been implemented. So far, there is a lot of talk about the problem with our American schools, unfortunately, no one seems to have stepped forward with a clear plan for how to solve the problems. All the while our children languish in schools that are distracted with other matters, leaving our without the excellent and challenging education they deserve.<br /><br />One very pleasant surprise was added to this book. Unlike other books of this kind, the author added footnotes and included an 18-page End Notes section and a nice Subject Index, too. I wish the footnotes had of been included at the bottom of the page noted, but just having them was such a surprise that I will refrain from further complaints. These additions are great for those fact-checkers in the audience.<br /><br />So, why is this book titled &#34;The Bee Eater?&#34; Well, you will just have to read the book to find out.mplexity of the problems in D.C., it would seem a more critical eye would have been appropriate and expected.

This book is not about the history of Sierra Leone, or a Hollywood tell-all.

Although it isn't necessary, one of the pleasures of these stories in their original format, is savoring one or two episodes, at a time.     Full Share continues to build characters into those that I have discussed with others, long after I finished the book.  Although I understand that 4 or 5 star reviews are necessary to entice readers only looking for 4 or 5 star choices. The more I read or hear, the more I think that many book reviews (and maybe this one) are premature. (I have read/heard the 6 books available to date, and another related, but not part of the series.) Although each episode/book stands alone, until you read or hear how the characters develop,you are likely to jump to the wrong conclusions.  I enjoyed the detail of these characters.

As the family is broken up, and as the journey progresses, this incredible account focuses on one boy who against surmounting odds maintains his personal faith in God. Spanning primarily Russian soil and Chinese soil during the time when Chiang Kai-shek was leading the army in China. The plot follows the journey of a Russian boy through Russia, China, the Philippines, Paraguay and finally to America.

The book does not possess distracting efforts by the author to make the book read well (something I really appreciate in this type of literature). It's a straight-forward account! I love it.<br /><br />I found the style of writing for this book to be clear, simple and very effective. I almost didn't notice the author's touch on the stories because I found myself immersed into the emotion of one event after another. By the time I finished many chapters I found myself teary eyed.

Readers may want to look at my review of his first volume, on Bereshit, to find out about Rabbi Riskin and his accomplishments. In this second volume, he offers from six to nine short incisive thought-provoking commentaries on each of the ten biblical portions that are read in synagogues from the book of Exodus, called Shemot in Hebrew. The essays generally combine a relevant and traditional approach to the Bible with many references to current events and time-honored and long-established Bible commentaries. He offers incisive answers to many interesting questions.<br /><br />He points out in his introduction that Maimonides felt that the first book of the Bible, Genesis, is Scripture's most important volume because it teaches that humans are created in the divine image, meaning that they have intelligence, and it urges people to use their intelligence. Maimonides also read into Genesis that every person, no matter what his or her religion, is a creation of God and must be respected and treated properly. However Rabbi Riskin prefers the view of the poet Yehuda HaLevi who felt that the most important book is Exodus because it speaks of the story of the birth of Israel.<br /><br /> Rabbi Riskin discusses many subjects. For example, in his first essay, he points out how important women are in Judaism. They hold the family together and help Judaism survive. Pharaoh made a strategic mistake when he told two women to kill all the Israelite males; he would have been more successful in exterminating the Israelites if had he tried to kill the females. Also, tradition states that the two women to whom he assigned this murder were Israelites, and they didn't carry out his instructions.<br /><br /> In another discussion, he tells why God appeared to Moses in a non-extinguished fire in a thorn bush. What do the burning fire and lowly thorn bush signify? Do they have meaning for us today? Does every rabbi agree what these items mean?

US	49026478	R20KC9QYDOIL4I	B004EBT6GU	916850869	Android Application Development For Dummies	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	5	6	7	N	Y	Review of the Kindle edition only	This is mostly a review of the Kindle edition. If I could swap in my Kindle edition for the paperback edition, then I would do it.    1) In the text it says that new or modified code is presented in bold. On the kindle none of the new code shows up as bold.    2) The Kindle inserts line breaks into the code, when it exceeds the window length. This is *very* confusing.    3) I need to flick between pages from time to time, which is not convenient on the Kindle.    I like the step-by-step procedure explanations in the book. Once Eclipse is set up, and you start looking at the Java and XML and have the emulator running, then you feel you are one step closer to creating your dream application.    I am really eager to create my application, so I would prefer the listings of code not to be interrupted by explanatory text. However, when I have to go back and look up something in the future, then I'm sure I'll appreciate all the explanations.    The code has in-line explanations, which I find really helpful.    I have no Java experience (I know Python), but I find that you can still work through the examples without knowledge of Java.    2 stars to the Kindle edition. 5 stars to the paperback edition.	2011-01-30

What a disappointment!<br /><br />This book is tripe.<br /><br />I had a very hard time liking any of the characters in this book, including the author.<br /><br />Comparing this \\\\\"book\\\\\" to Angela's Ashes is beyond my comprehension.  Frank McCourt had a way with writing that pulled you into the characters and their behavior.  His true gift, however, was that he also portrayed them as human and flawed in a way that made you understand, just a little, what their lives were like.<br /><br />This author lacks that gift.<br /><br />Page after page I found myself shaking my head in disgust at the behavior of the parents and dangerous situations that they put their children in.  Did the author approve of starving and sleeping in a box?  Did she approve of her father's alcoholism?  Did she approve of her mother's neglect and self-centered attitude about letting children raise themselves?  If she had any opinion as to what she felt, it certainly didn't come across in her writing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a story similar to Angela's Ashes, please read Change Me Into Zeus' Daughter by Barbara Robinette Moss.  It's fantastic!"	2010-07-19

"The third installment of Soul Mates had me gripping the book (well, my Kindle) with white knuckles. Peter is not really human anymore, and not really vampire. To make matters worse, he appears to be part Lycan too. The three parts are fighting with each other, and it's killing him in the process. He needs to be \\\\\"turned\\\\\" into a full vampire, or die very shortly, yet Lucien is reluctant to change him. When we discover why Lucien is reluctant, the story gains an emotional edge that elevates and propels it. Add into this an attack on his grandparents, which left them dead, and the continuation of the other dramas within their coven, and it's a gripping read.<br /><br />As with the fist two stories, there is good excitement in the story, and the characters are highly-detailed and unique. Dialog is excellent, placement is excellent, and the story flows swiftly, maintaining the readers interest. There is a healthy dose of romance, and an even larger dose of erotica in the story, and it's a good read.<br /><br />The novel was on par with the other chapters in the story, but towards the end, had a scene with incredible emotional and psychological impact. I have to admit, I was horrified. With the first-person perspective being used, I was totally and completely pulled into the experience and it shocked and stunned me. I was, and still am, haunted by it.<br /><br />What a story!!!"	2010-06-09

Among other examples of his work, this song spoke to me directly about choices and decisions that I have faced in my own life, and the consequences for consistently making the same mistakes over and over again.  For all those who seem to continually fall into the same pitfalls, this song offers both sympathy and hope that we can someday learn Who is the Person that we most need to listen to; Someone who never gives up on us, and never fails to deliver His promises.	2012-09-07

Preparation:  Very fresh eggs produce the best shape when frying eggs.  Place a small non-stick frying pan over the lowest possible heat on your stove (if using gas, you should barely see the blue flame.)  Add the butter and let slowly melt, making sure it doesn't foam and is not sizzling  When all the butter has melted, crack the egg into a small bowl, dish, or saucer (taking care not to break the yolk and to remove any shell fragments).  gas flame on lowest heat  Butter in the pan waiting to slowly melt.        butter in frying pan  Butter in the pan waiting to slowly melt.        egg on small saucer  Egg on small saucer.     Gently slide the egg off the dish into the frying pan and cover with a lid.  Continue cooking approximately 5 minutes until the egg white solidifies from transparency into snow-white cream; the yolk will thicken slightly as it heats. How quickly the egg cooks is dependent on how low you have the heat.  Do not flip the eggs but leave the egg sunny-side up and natural.  egg in frying pan before lid  Egg in frying pan before placing lid on top        egg in frying pan with lid  Pan covered with lid.        perfect fried egg  After approximately 5 minutes, fried egg is cooked.

Or use a regular skillet and add a small amount of butter or oil.  Break eggs and gently slip into the skillet.  Immediately reduce heat to low.  Cook slowly until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not hard (turning eggs gently to cook both sides or adding a small amount of water and covering with lid to cook tops of eggs).  Season with salt and pepper as desired.  Steam-Fried Eggs:  Reduce butter to just enough to grease pan or use light coating of cooking spray and/or nonstick pan.  In a frying pan over medium-high heat, heat butter until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.  Break and slip eggs into pan.  Immediately reduce heat to low.  Cook until edges turn white, about 1 minutes.  Add 1 teaspoon water (for more eggs, decrease proportion slightly for each additional egg being cooked). Cover pan tightly with lid to hold in steam.  Cook until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not hard.  Remove from pan and season as desired.	2011-11-06

However, RIO BRAVO is a damned good movie, period! John Wayne plays Sheriff JT Chance, who finds himself holding a dangerous murderer (Claude Akins) in the town jail, to await the arrival of a U.S. Marshal. This wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact that the killer's brother, Nathan (John Russell) is VERY determined to get him out! Once Nathan and his gang of thugs show up, Chance and a small band of Deputies must hold them off, in order for justice to be served. RIO BRAVO was directed by the legendary Howard Hawks, as part of a brilliant trilogy, along w/ EL DORADO and RIO LOBO. If that's not enough, it co-stars Dean Martin as Dude, an alcoholic gunslinger, an unbelievably stunning Angie Dickinson as Miss Feathers, Ricky Nelson as up-and-coming gunman, Colorado, and Walter Brennan as a cranky Deputy called Stumpy. The tension builds slowly, leading up to a satisfying finale. Wayne is his iconic self, while Martin and Nelson play their supporting roles w/ ease, even getting a chance to sing a song together! As for Ms. Dickinson, well... let's just say that when she's on screen, I forget what movie I'm watching! This movie is perfect from start to finish...	2015-05-11

The plot is cut up into six &#34;lessons&#34;--episodes of around ten minutes each.  Each episode is cute, light-hearted, and inconsequential.  The subtitles are effectively non-existent, but the material is so light that there's not much context that isn't visually shown.  On that point, the drawn art is technically solid and effectively uses an animated-comic style.	2015-03-14

The screen moved so fast to the next page, that when I hit the back key (after choosing to cancel order) it seems that the cancellation was cancelled.    I think there are too many areas where proximity of places to select options are too close on the page to undesired options.  Maybe create more, less crowded pages or slow things down a bit once cancellations are attempted?    Vexed	2015-02-05

It left me confused, but not angry and feeling like I &#34;wasted my time&#34;. This movie--for me--was a good confusing. I appreciated that the characters actually had some depth and weren't 2-dimensional stiffs to be knocked off one by one (which is overdone by too many of these kinds of films). When I saw this was on Amazon I got curious and decided to watch it again, and honestly I understood so much more this time, because I went into it realizing it was a movie with a lot of twists. I see a lot of critical comments here and personally think it's because people are going into it assuming it won't take any effort to understand. And yes, a lot of horror films are like that, which is why I'm not particularly fond of the genre. But this is less a &#34;horror&#34; film, in my opinion, and is more like creepy found footage that keeps you guessing. Honestly, if you enjoy a smart film, this is for you. If you're looking for a cheap horror film with no substance, look elsewhere. I wouldn't give such a lengthy review, but all of the 1 star comments are just comical...as someone who's seen this movie and many many others, I can't understand such negative feedback. Seems like a group of friends with a personal vendetta or some people who are just way too torn up over having to spend a little money to see an indie film. Personally, I thought it was pretty awesome.	2014-12-30

One of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.  It's a chilling version of future chaos in the world.  In England, the anarchy centers around immigration in a kind of &#34;immigrant holocaust.&#34;  The main problem, however, is that, in England and in the entire world, women can no longer conceive.  There are no children.  Clive Owen delivers the best performance of his career, in a realistic portrayal of an embittered and depressed man who finds a sacred purpose.  The most poignant moment in the movie is a momentary cease-fire, in which men cannot possibly kill one another or hate one another--a brief, but moving, moment of unity of all mankind.  The Children of Men involves much loss and is sometimes difficult to watch, though the violence is not at all gratuitous.  It is redeemed by the core love of the hero--who would not ever describe himself as such and would never have asked for the job.	2014-12-14

Real life drama combined with excellent acting offers its audience a glimpse into how governmental regulations can affect common people who take necessary and sensible actions to improve the quality of their lives. I personally loved the references to tradition and how it becomes ingrained into our lives through generations; in particular, the pine table that was constructed by hand that help memories with every scratch and stain.<br /><br />This movie solidifies the fact that common sense is far more powerful and sensible than government regulation. Excellent film with a heartfelt, intense message.	2014-11-22

Warning: This review may contain important plot points away    The Black Stallion is one of my favorite films of all time, and it was this majestic piece that make me go read the book.  In a nutshell, this movie feels like two different stories that star the same characters. The first is about a young boy who meets a wild black stallion on a ship, and the two survivors escape a shipwreck and bond together on an island  The second part is the boy training the Black to become a racehorse with the help of Henry Dailey, portrayed by the late Mickey Rooney.  There are just no words that can describe this film in its purest form. It's a treat for me as a horse lover, and the parts on the beach are my favorite, not just because I love the beach, but it just seems to be where the power and majesty of the Black and his bond with Alec is best witnessed.  As for what was done to the character of Alec, I honestly liked the idea of turning him into a young boy, rather than sticking with the teenager. It just seems to make the relationship between him and the Black more meaningful. Think about it; a giant, wild and dangerous stallion tamed by a vulnerable young child.  On a more personal scale, this movie portrays the sort of relationship I want to have with a horse someday; a single-hearted love and devotion.  Everything this film has to offer just mixes well together; the majestic landscapes, the stellar acting  of not just the humans actors, but of the horses, including the handsome Cass Ole. The soundtrack is like the Black himself, moving, soul-pleasing, powerful and mysterious. The film just has that charm, innocence and magic that only those old films seem to posses.  Whether or not you have read this book (which I also recommend), I highly recommend this to any avid horse lover. It's a real soul-pleaser and just wonderful right down to the ending credits.	2014-09-24

One has to wonder if things may have gone differently if the show did not air information between the girls about his domestic violence with Taylor and Russell. There seems to be little awareness that broadcasting private family dramas can create more chaos and craziness; however, in the reunion shows they did show some ability to say they kept some things private. This is not to say domestic violence should be kept secret, but blabbing it about all over the world is another matter, especially when people are in the middle of therapy for it.  That said, they did seem ill matched and seemed to inflame each other.  The characters while interesting can rarely take any feedback about their behavior in the moment except for Adrienne and her husband and to some extent Lisa and Ken. Otherwise, they all seem clueless about listening to what others say, routinely interrupting each other and having little empathy for others; later, it seems some of them do seem to come around to hear others out. It is amazing how quickly some of them can make enemies, over one small incident and even after the other person tries to make it right, but perhaps there is more than what we see on screen. Life is already hard enough but making enemies out of a simple comments is foolish. Camille is showing more of the cool woman she is in this season. Brandi, while adorable and fun, can't control her mean streak and does not realize that her words have more power than she imagines. In the end, most of these folks seem sincere, but self reflection is not their strong suit.	2014-06-30

My husband and I saw the movie three years ago just before we married. Afterwards, we were planning on pizza and beer for dinner, but as we walked out of the movie we made a B-line to the Veggie Grill and haven't looked back since. We weren't planning on going on a vegetarian almost vegan diet, but how can one not after seeing the evidence presented in a simple fashion. It worked for us.<br /><br />My husband lost 65 pounds and I lost 10 pounds. I love finding new exciting ways to cook the foods we now love.

Girls avoids a lot of your typical clichés which make it refreshing. Especially for a &#34;female&#34; series; there is a sorry lack of smart programming. So many shows/movies are almost insulting. Even though the Girls are meant to make mistakes and when watching sometimes you will think &#34;What is she doing?&#34; the characters have complexity which is usually reserved for television's male characters.<br />Much of this has to do with Lena Dunham, who stars, directs, and created this series. I was very impressed with her talent. Do I think Girls defines my generation? No - but the show definitely offers a different perspective than previously seen and I do find it relatable. It represents the time in your life when you have the education, and maybe even your intelligence has made you successful in school, but now you have to figure out what's next and how to survive in the adult world. The attitude shift in relationships is also interesting - the transition of the casual relationship that was typical in college to navigating serious, mature relationships.<br />My &#34;Not for Everyone&#34; comment is that this show has a quirky humor that you will probably love or hate. You will not see broad, sitcom-like setup humor. For me, I was laughing out loud (hard) through the whole first season. But I also have a weird sense of humor so I am on the same wavelength. Lena's Hannah is for me the most interesting. Lena is brave in that she lets her character do and experience things that aren't the most glamorous. She has flaws, but not in the silly cutesy way where the romcom heroine is just a little klutzy. She seems like one of your real girlfriends. Jemima is a charismatic actress, and her Jessa is a force that is fun to watch. Marnie is a foil for Hannah. She is gorgeous but also has her flaws. For me, Shoshanna is the weakest part of the show, but she is also the least featured so I didn't mind her too much. The up-speaking delivery I find annoying and the character is one-note (at least for this first season). Hannah's sometimes-boyfriend Adam is a gem.	2014-04-21

I'll stop short of that, but picture and sound quality do get in the way of the experience.<br /><br />The picture is blurry, making all but the largest text on the screen will be illegible. At one point, you're meant to be able to read a newspaper headline, and I had to get very close to the screen to make it out. The dialogue is intelligible, though you have to listen carefully. The audio improves on the train -- if you're still bothered by the quality at that point, then this one won't be for you.<br /><br />The movie itself is only 1 hour long. If you're looking for a taste of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and Watson, this gets the job done. Holmes is quick-witted and smoothly sophisticated, a marked contrast to Jeremy Brett and Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayl of the great detective as socially awkward. Watson serves as foil to Holmes here, rather than a partner in crime solving. Mildly amusing, as long as you don't think of him as your own doctor.<br /><br />This story is essentially a dramatic version of a bedroom farce, set in the confines of a train -- lots of doors opening and closing, a few mistaken identities, and all's well in the end. Not the best Rathbone/Bruce outing, but it's good company over lunch.	2014-01-27

I am overall very happy with the finale.  The show was the best ever on television.  The only things that could have made the finale over the top with awesomeness are the following:<br /><br />1. Skyler hugs Walt before he leaves.  I mean come on, they were married for like 20 years and no hug before he goes to his death?  Cold. Deep down Sky was ganster, she told him to kill Jessie, so she had a little Tony Montana in her as well.<br /><br />2.  Jessie got the cash.  Walt's whole goal was to steal back his money, yet he blasted Jack before he found the cash.  Criminals always torture, get info, then execute.  Basic stuff.<br /><br />3.  Jessie brings it in for the real thing.  Jessie also should have given Walt a hug. (I am big on hugs)  I mean he came there to face almost certain death, albeit with MacGuyver like tricks in the trunk, to save Jessie.  The least he could have done was give his surrogate dad a hug.  He taught him to cook sweet meth!<br /><br />4.  To extrapolate on #2, Jessie should have gotten the cash and adopted Brock.  They could have had a &#34;6 Months Later&#34; scene, and he could have been in Alaska with Brock riding Caribou (with massive cash overflowing their Caribou saddle bags) on a nice, scenic trail.  The camera would pan out, and Walt's face would be in the sky, with some clouds, and he could be smiling on them.	2014-01-10

John Cusak is definitely an accomplished actor- so it isn't often he makes a movie that just doesn't make the grade; this movie was not widely billed and it is done as a &#34;character study&#34; for sure- but the story is strong and the acting is excellent.  Both he and Malin really develop their characters and before you know it you are right there with them engaged in the story and interested in the outcome.  Fair amount of action with a little suspense- no cheesey feats of heroism (again it's John Cusak).. very watchable and enjoyable.	2013-10-18

This documentary carries a message that redeems much of what global advertising fails to do, which is mainly to connect us with something artful and truthful, something that joins us in the journey as opposed to assaulting us along the way.  The individuals interviewed were thoughtful and subtle in their explorations and it took the greater part of the film for them to reveal the beliefs that drive them and some few others in their profession to success. I feel their message applies to whatever path one walks through life: if you wish to live a meaningful life and do meaningful work, you have to retain the courage continually to reconnect your life and work with creative and truthful intent.

However, it was more of a Coming of Age story where she eventually realizes her value and worth. I enjoyed the storytelling as well as the type of humor. I did find that it felt more like an 80s movie than a 90s flick, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.	2013-07-21

But if action packed dark thrillers fill the bill for you then WELCOME TO THE PUNCH certainly will.  Just be prepared that a lot of the story begs indulgence until the very end.<br /><br />The film opens in medias res with a robbery where one perpetrator Jacob Sternwood (the always reliable Mark Strong is a very sold portrayal) wounds eager detective Max Lewinsky (James McAvoy looking a bit scruffy with a wannabe beard) in the leg. Three years later the story begins. Now `former criminal' Jacob Sternwood is forced to return to London from his Icelandic hideaway when his son Ruan (the very handsome and sensitive and underused Elyes Gabel) is involved in a heist gone wrong. This gives detective Max Lewinsky one last chance to catch the man he has always been after. His partner is a female version of Max - Sarah Hanks (Andrea Riseborough)- and the tow are under the leadership of detectives Thomas Geiger (David Morrissey) and Harvey Crown (Jason Flemyng). Events begin to change with eh entry of a new criminal Dean Warns (Johnny Harris) and his presence begins to open doors as to who is really a good guy and who is a bad guy. As they face off, they start to uncover a deeper conspiracy Jacob and Max both need to solve in order to survive.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly fine, including the bit parts played by such actors as Daniel Kaluuya, Ruth Sheen, Daniel Mays and Dannielle Brent.  The story involves good cop/bad cop, transformation of images, political snafus, and a lot of firepower.  The plot is often too muddled to decipher but the action is fast and the acting is super.

And then the Titans came along. I got them for $20 and it was the best $20 I ever spent. These have lasted me three years now and after trying many different kinds of earbuds in the price range, including the Brainwaves ones and the Meelectronic ones that everyone recommends on Amazon (having looked through the reviews of those earbuds more recently, I noticed most people had been sent a pair by the manufacturer, which makes me suspicious) I can safely say that I doubt there are many better pairs of earbuds for the price. Skullcandy really outdid themselves with this product. They sound PHENOMENAL. I've compared them side-to-side with the Ink'ds, 50/50s, Meelectronics, JVC, and Apple earbuds and these blow them out of the water.  I don't care what the audiophiles say about Skullcandy. This particular pair of earbuds outperforms the other Skullcandy models to a great degree and is worth a try for anyone wanting sleek and great sounding earbuds.	2015-08-28

Have no idea why the reviews here are more than two stars.  This Hesh 2 is not worth the $100.  There are two good things about this headset:<br /><br />1.  They don't fall off easily like the Sennheiser wireless headphones.<br />2.  The battery charge life is long<br /><br />BUT, these two things are not offset by the defects in design:<br /><br />1.  The sound is muffled, poor, and lacks brilliance.<br />2.  The buttons for on/off, higher volume, and lower volume and not palpable.  To locate and use them one has to remove the headset to find the + and - buttons, unless one is skilled in braille.<br />3.  My set was NOT stereo.<br />4.  They apply a bit too much pressure on the head, but that's improved if one reverses right and left.<br />5.  No treble/bass adjustment (the company alleges that this feature will be added in the near future)<br />6.  The signal travels about only 20 feet max.  My other pair is wireless, not bluetooth, and they transmit at least 100 feet.<br /><br />Returning this set to the retailer.	2015-06-10

Fits the hole placement of our Visio 42&#34; TV  but doesn't keep it upright very well.  The adjustment on the back won't lock tight enough to keep it in an upright position, it falls so is always pointing down towards ground.  We are using it out on the patio so do want it slightly down to avoid the sun shining directly onto it but it is either up or down, doesn't seem to be a middle ground.	2015-04-20

One of the first two was DOA, but I ordered more thinking I just got a bad one.  RMA process was easy so I ordered more.  I have since discovered that they get pretty warm and they will drive only a single display.  If I run to a VGA splitter or a VGA to IP capture server inline, it will fail and just flicker.  I can't capture the stream and I can't split the signal to run two displays without overloading the convertor.  If you only want to run a single display, these may work for you.

I use these with the JayBird BlueBuds X.  I highly recommend getting the mixed pack till you know exactly what fit is best for you.  If your fit is not right, your sound quality will suffer.  I found that I needed to use these a few times at the gym before I really knew which ones worked best for me.

I don't see &#34;Made in China&#34; anywhere on them or on the box they were shipped, so I guess they are made in the USA.

I remember as a kid watching Kung Fu and Grasshopper asked his Master:  &#34;Master why is there so much bad in the world?&#34;  And the Master replied &#34;Grasshopper if there is no bad there can be no good&#34;.  Well I've tried every type of rechargeable AA battery I could get my hands on for the last 5 years and they all sucked.  Most would work for a month or two then not charge, they would lose their charge quickly or they just didn't last 1/4 as long as a Alkaline.  There is nothing spectacular about these batteries but they are the first brand that ACTUALLY WORK.  They charge all the time, they last long and I don't have to mess around with dead/discharged batteries anymore.  I use them for radios, camera flashes, flashlights and the reason they are so great is that they just don't suck like everything else out there. I hgot my first set of 20 about a year ago and have had no issues and I have since ordered more.	2014-12-24

[[VIDEOID:f10e7561f1847f35903fccb54d6d15d0]]I mostly love these earphones! They are awesome our reducing background noise. I had a coworker standing next to me yelling, never heard a thing. I am a big fan of in-ear delivery. Hard earbuds hurt my ears after a time, these are perfectly comfortable the whole time. The area around the ear is adjustable, allowing you to fit it to the curve of you ear. It helps give hat snug fit when you are using them while exercising.<br /><br />Bonus these come with a cute little case that travels easily. This is also important for helping me protect them from my evil cat!<br /><br />Here is the only down side, every time I take them out the rubber comes off the ends. This is more than a little annoying. I have to dig it out of my ear every single time. It makes listening at work difficult, because people are always coming up to talk to me. It it had not been for this annoyance, this would have been an easy five stars.<br /><br />Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

Being so small it was quite powerful. Our rooms in our house are on the small size maybe that helped. Don’t know don’t care-they sounded great! Set up was a breeze too-I was expecting something that was going to take me hours to figure out but that was not the case as far as this product was concerned. I noticed they have one in a blue color too which I did not care for but my son thought was real cool so it might be on Santa’s list this year.

While using the mic on these, the headset switches to low quality audio that just sounds horrible.  This is a limitation of bluetooth.  They also have a bit of lag to them as well.  Not a ton, but some.<br /><br />These headphones have a lot of potential, however I almost feel like these will need some sort of equalization before they will really shine.  They have strong bass if you can find an equalizer that will work through bluetooth.  I bought these for using while mowing the lawn mostly, and for when I didn't feel like being wired like moving about in my house.<br /><br />These are the devices I have found that can utilize an equalizer through bluetooth.<br />Windows 7 - Nothing found<br />Windows 8 - Has support to boost bass only, but didn't really help much.<br />Mac os - Most equalizers work<br />Android - There are a ton of equalizers for this headset with android	2014-10-14

So starting with my lowered expectations I wanted something that can play music and answer my calls in a kayak or small boat while my phone is safe in a water proof case. I got the rox also due to the tripod mounting plate to allow a more secure fitting and a small ram tripod camera ball mount to go with it. I charged it up and synced it with my iPhone at the beach then played music to try it out. The speakers have the same sound quality as your typical $30 computer speakers so definitely not great but at least listenable, not very loud either but loud enough to hear with waves crashing 20 ft away. If you think about it they took a set of $30 computer speakers, added a 1800mah battery and a water proof case and Bluetooth module, I guess looking  at that it is worth it's asking price and it did work.<br /><br /> Splashed water over it and it keeps playing, no issues there but don't drop in in deep as the little seal in the back is really meant to stop a splash not to submerge the whole unit. The rubber outer coating feels a little cheap as are some plastic welds but you can't expect more at this price and it does look like it will be a little durable. I'm giving it 5 stars as from reading other reviews I was expecting much less and got more, it works as advertised and looks like it will last a little while plus I could not find anything else at the price that could fast forward thru my iPhone play list with waves splashing it.	2014-09-24
US	25131526	R1EZ5898BFREIC	B00MV1X0TE	368844779	VM Audio Elux 8-Inch 270 Watt 2-Way In-Wall Surround Sound Speaker | VM-WA8-E	Electronics	4	0	0	N	N	Pleasantly surprised!	Unboxing:<br />The speakers came triple boxed which was a nice surprise when I went to open them. Even if they were double boxed, they would travel fine because they also rest in a cardboard &#34;cradle&#34; that holds them securely during shipment.<br />Inside they are covered by a protective piece of cardboard and also wrapped in a clear plastic bag. No packing peanuts!!! +1 VM Audio!!!<br /><br />Ease of installation:<br />These install just like all of the other in-wall speakers with screw type mounting tabs that rotate into position and effectively clamp the sheetrock surrounding the opening. I had to make some slight modifications to the mounting tabs (cutting off 1/4&#34;) because my walls have 5/8&#34; thick sheetrock instead of the typical 1/2&#34; in most homes. The included cut out template was of cardboard-like paper which made for easy cutting of the openings. I took my stud finder and picked two stud cavities on either side of my wall-mounted TV and marked the center of where I wanted the speakers. I then leveled the templates with a bubble level and taped them into place, cut out the perimeter with a razor blade and then followed the guidelines with a drywall saw. The templates are an invaluable item to have and make for a simple, accurate hole for easy, yet snug installation. The templates were clearly marked for where to cut, however the measurements were off from what they needed to be (the text accurately reads the right size but the lines actually measure 0.7&#34; less in both directions). I let VM Audio know of this issue and they're working on getting the templates fixed. Not a big deal at all but something to pay attention to. Once the holes were cut it was easy to connect the wires, slide the speaker in and screw it in place. The tabs work well to secure the speaker in the wall but don't over tighten them because you risk striping the mounting tabs. Over-tightening actually ruins the threads and makes them not as tight as if you hadn't. Justget them snug and they'll be fine. When at high volume I don't feel any air movement around the edges so they fit snugly against the wall. I already had fiberglass batt insulation in my walls and highly recommend having it within the cavity these get installed in. I had fished the CL2-rated wires (make sure your wiring is rated for in-wall use!) down within the same stud cavity and installed speaker wall plates that have gold banana type terminals. These not only provide the best speaker wire connection but they are inexpensive and look great! Win WAF (Wife Approval Factor) points and get them for your installation; you can thank me later!<br /><br />Overall Build Quality:<br />When you remove the metal grille you will find a thin dark gray foam pad that's secured by foam tape. This not only protects the drivers but also hides them once the grille is installed. A nice touch since if they weren't there, you would clearly see the bright yellow cone of the mid. The tweeter has it's own integral grille to protect it which is a great feature since it would be very susceptible to damage otherwise.<br /><br />The plastic surround is of decent quality and will accept paint easily. I had planned on painting them to match my walls, but the soft white is a nice finish.<br /><br />The drivers are held in place with screws and the XO as well (I was expecting adhesive at this price-point). The spring loaded speaker terminals are my least favorite part of these speakers. They are flimsy and don't give me any confidence in the connections. I found a pair of male spade connection points under the XO (directly under the terminals) that I used instead. I'm glad they were there so I could get a much more secure, trustworthy wiring connection. Problem solved without any modifications, just needed female spade connectors!<br /><br />Listening impressions:<br />Over the last two years I've only been using my living room AVR in stereo mode with a pair of speakers at a time. I've tried a pair of Dayton B-652's, my pair of DIY Tritrix TL's and a pair of Klipsch B-2's (during separate times) to the Onkyo. Now I'm giving the VM Audio WA-8 in-walls a chance and hopefully going to a 5.1 setup finally!<br /><br />The tweeters are of excellent quality for the price of these speakers. They get loud and clear and don't sound &#34;tinny&#34; or too &#34;bright&#34;. They're also not muted nor shrill. They're very pleasant to listen to and when given the chance I'll pull out some of my old live jazz and blues CDs to see how great they perform. They are almost as smooth as the Dayton tweeter in my Tritrix TL's, and those are VERY nice for the money! To put them even close to those tweeters is saying a lot for a speaker in this price range. They sound WAY better than the Dayton bookshelves but aren't as dynamic or neutral as my Klipsch's (costing 3x as much).<br /><br />I had my Onkyo TX-NR515 volume up to 52 and these wanted more!<br /><br />Side-note: The XO within my AVR was set to high-pass these at 80Hz with no other speakers connected and no sub (ordering a Dayton SUB-1200 soon).<br /><br />I plan on trying them with my higher powered Pioneer AVR soon to see how they handle more power. I could not get them to break-up even with very dynamic movie soundtracks such as Transformers and Tron. I don't think they are as efficient as the published specs indicate since I had to turn up the volume much higher than other speakers I've used with this AVR.<br /><br />The midwoofer in these is of decent quality, however I think a more efficient driver would do better given that it has a tough time keeping up with the more efficient tweeter. Some may not notice this but I have discerning ears. Maybe a slight modification to the XO would help attenuate the tweeter some (L-pad?). But even with all of that said, I was pleasantly surprised by the output these mids had for such a modest price point.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />For all intents and purposes, these speakers are in the budget category, however, they perform WAY better than I had anticipated and I will be ordering another three, one for center and a pair for rear surrounds to complete my living room 5.1 system. I had planned on going with a single 10&#34; subwoofer to match these with but now I'm seriously considering going with a 12&#34; to keep up! If you're looking for an excellent sounding, bang-for-your-buck in-wall speaker, you should seriously give the VM Audio WA-8 Elux's a try. For the price, they're worth the audition. I think you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I am!	2014-09-21

Six of these instantly went in to replace the crappy Panasonic rechargeables that came with a set of wireless phones.

Although my previous unit is more powerful than this unit, I have found this to have more than enough power for my room.  The unit does NOT have a switched outlet on the back like my older unit however, so I had to come up with a different solution to be able to have my sub-woofer and other equipment turn on automatically when I turn the receiver on.  Otherwise, this upgraded unit has basically the same Yamaha DSP settings and capabilities to further enhance the sound as my receiver from 15 years ago.  It's just got an upgraded digital and on-screen interface for settings and a built-in EQ setting mode and microphone to adjust your speakers.  After reading reviews about how poorly this worked though, I didn't bother.  I have my EQ flat and it sounds fine with my high-end speakers and room, but you can easily tweak the EQ with the on-screen menu if you like.  Also, it's quite easy to set the 5.1 speaker volumes using the pink noise generator and just listening as the sound moves from speaker to speaker, as you adjust the volume levels.  Overall, an excellent unit and for most people, I would imagine there is absolutely no reason to spend twice this amount on higher-end models unless you have a home theater and like to listen to near-deafening sound levels!	2014-01-07

I prefer a mount that uses two studs and leveling was a breeze.  Plus, it really is low profile.  The mount when fully retracted is only 3&#34; from the wall.

I was recently issued an HP Envy TS15 laptop for use at work.  It comes with 1 HDMI output for an external monitor. Well, my Dell u2412m monitor at home only has one DVI port, which was currently occupied by an HDMI-to-DVI adapter cable connected to the ATI video card in my desktop computer. I'm also someone who hates to plug more things in around my desk. I am also always skeptical of switches like this one for something like HDMI that do not have their own external power source.  But it had great reviews, a great price, and I've got a Prime membership, so I gave it a shot.  I'm not at all disappointed so far.  I have 2 Amazon Basic HDMI cables connecting the laptop and desktop to the switch with a BlueRigger HDMI-to-DVI adapter cable from the switch to the monitor.  Switching between sources works seamlessly. I don't see any noticeable difference when compared to connecting directly to the monitor.  I thought for sure, from past experience with connecting various adapters of different types, that the DVI adapter cable would cause some issues with the switch, but it works just fine.  Even the two Windows PCs - and a Macbook Air that I tried - all handled the switching of displays nicely and there's no reconfiguration needed once I have calibrated the display the first time. The status light on the switch also turns off when the source stops sending a signal.  So when the computer is turned off or goes to sleep, there is no status light.  However I didn't find the light overly bright like another reviewer, so it wouldn't be a big deal if it stayed lit.  They said their switch had a blue light, but both of mine are green.  So there may have been an updated model released.  I don't see any visible model number on the device - I already discarded the package, so it may be shown there.  I will include a disclaimer for my review - I am not using this for connecting TVs or with audio.  But I think it would work just as well in those applications, given my good experience so far.  Usually these types of devices are either very good or just don't work when using multiple types/brands of connected sources, so I am very pleased, and somewhat surprised, with the quality and performance.so far.

This means one cannot easily pause video in MX Player, which is shame for using Plex or a DLNA app to watch content, and that the music listening experience in Plex or DLNA is a bit sullied by the lack of being able to skip or replay a track at the touch of a button on the remote. (By contrast such functions are at least accessible using the included remote in XBMC's internal player, but only from a controls overlay that is a bit distracting.)<br /><br />Second: most Android apps, such as Netflix, are clearly written for a touchscreen interface and don't work with the included remote. That isn't Minix's fault, but it does mean that you will need an airmouse, or an airmouse/keyboard combo remote, a trackpad/keyboard combo remote (in order of increasing size). Search the Minix forums for advice on the strengths and weaknesses of the many products out there, as well as enhancements and workarounds. (Or you can also use an Android phone or tablet to double as a remote, but then it probably won't live next to the TV.) But the bias toward the touchscreen interface is a problem that Google needs to address in its tools and standards for Android development (which means that it is unlikely to ever happen, especially given the ChromeCast stick).<br /><br />Note that an airmouse remote will bring the system cost up by somewhere between a twenty and a pair of Jacksons, at which price point the Mini costs as much as or is more expensive than a very polished competitor such as an Apple TV or a Roku. So for a relatively similar price, you get an imperfect set-top box but a more open and complete computing platform. Not only that, but this an Android device that iseasily rooted and highly customizable for tinkerers.<br /><br />A minor issue I experienced was that Minix's included GridShow launcher app also lacks polish, and I quickly found myself replacing it with free GooglePlay apps like Lightning Launcher or SmartLauncher. This instantly made the X5 Mini look and feel a lot more like a consumer-grade product.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, this is a really fun machine. It isn't quite the perfect Android TV set-top box yet, nor is it dead simple like the Roku, but if you like to customize your toys you'll enjoy the X5 Mini. There's also the brand new quad-core X7 Mini with a design, remote, and functionality similar to the X5 Mini, but you'll pay a premium for the jump up in processor speed--and still need to buy an airmouse. I think Minix makes the best Android TV set-top replacement on the market today, and the X5 Mini reveals that true technological convergence is just about to arrive.	2013-09-17

Electronics	5	3	3	N	Y	Best deal I have found on the Internet	This package deal is absolutely incredible.  I was going to buy all the same speakers with the exception of the PL-200 subs, and was looking at getting a Denon receiver that did 7.2 surround as well.  Just for the Klipsch reference speakers in this package, it would cost you over $3800.  So you are getting the rear surrounds, the receiver, and the two subwoofers basically for free.  And you get a full warranty as the seller is an authorized reseller of the equipment and well known in the industry.  I got my system all setup at home and paired it with an Epson 5020UB 3D projector and a 100&#34; Elite DH2 3D screen and it is fantastic!  I love everything about this package with the exception of the HarmonKardon receiver.  The HK 3700 receiver is very nice, but the menu systems are clunky, and the support department was terrible.  I was having my video cut out on my during movies, and gave them a call to find out why.  They said they don't support any HDMI cables over 15 feet at all for TVs or projectors.  I told them that cables are used up to 50 feet all the time for these purposes, but they said it won't work on their system.  So they left me hanging and I had to come up with my own solution.  The speakers are amazing, the subs will blow you out of the water with amazing bass.  Definitely get this great package and save a ton of money.	2013-06-03

At work I used to work most of the time with closed headphones because I deliberately wanted to not hear anything around me.<br /><br />However, removing my headphones every time someone wants to speak to me, not hearing the phone ring etc. changed my mind. Now the little, easy to remove on-ear HD239 perfectly fit the bill. Sound quality and detail is exceptional. These headphones actually hold up very well against my Ultrasone Pro 750, Sennheiser HD449 and other that I use at work.<br /><br />So, in short, I am extremely happy with my purchase. Wish though they had a sturdier cable and would come with an 6.3mm adapter."	2013-04-30

I also have a One which is my favorite. So being a person that always goes for the latest and greatest I bought this Touch. Big mistake! I've given up trying to get it programmed. Why? The online set up is so bad that you quickly get lost. You hope that you are making the right choices, but you have no way to know until you sync the remote. Then it is impossible to figure out what you need to do to fix your problem. As an example, the LCD screen has a soft button that says '123', which gives you a number pad. I need that number pad to select channels on my Motorola cable box. Does it work? NO! Is there any reference to change the behavior of the num pad in the software? None that I can find. Does a search of the Harmony FAQ reveal any ideas on how to fix this problem? Again,none that I can find.<br /><br />I'm giving this 1 star based on build quality and comfort in the hand. Other than that it is junk. Buy the Harmony One!<br /><br />So, I now I'm stuck with a useless $250 touch screen.<br /><br />Update 3/17/2013<br />I submitted a trouble ticket to Logitec about my problems. The response told me to delete my Motorola cable box and re-install the device. That worked! Now it will not control any of my devices. It is now totally useless. I've spent at least 5 hours screwing around with this train wreck of a product.<br />DO NOT PURCHASE THIS REMOTE!!!!!	2013-03-10

Here is a brand from a company that I have known and trusted - and that, generally, people seem to be happy with.<br /><br />The sound quality of these buds is pretty great - great bass, wide range, comfortable in the ear, etc.  The fact that they only last 3 months, however, has forced me to leave an unfavorable review.<br /><br />I can't believe how disappointed I am with these headphones.  After only three months, notwithstanding my completely \\\\\"baby-ing\\\\\" this pair of buds, the wires at the end of the audio connector are already showing.  The sheathing has come apart from the plug, and bare wires are visible.  Even though they have been kept in their protective carrying case every single moment they were not in my ears, they fell apart like a pair of cheaply made $5 buds you can buy at the local drug store...<br /><br />I have sent out an email to Logitech to request a refund, or at the very least, a replacement set.  As far as a review goes, however, I'd have to say stay far, far away from these.  I had a set of Westone UM1 earbuds that, although they LOOK like they are flimsier, lasted me over 3 years.  For a $100+ pair of earbuds, these UE headphones don't perform as well as sets 1/10th of the price.  Most certainly not worth the cost (even if you can get them at an 80% discount).<br /><br />Disappointed.<br /><br />If you're like me - you might be deciding between these and the Klipsch equivalent (something like the S4i).  Go with the Klipsch.  I have a feeling the 90 degree (right-angle) audio connector is the root cause of this issue.  It's simply a design flaw that, unfortunately, will remain unchanged even if you manage to get a replacement.<br /><br />EDIT - One more quick note.  I've just upgraded to the iPhone 5 and it appears that the buttons no longer work (for any function - no volume - no play/pause - no answering calls).  I'm not sure if this is an iOS 6 issue - or aniPhone 5 issue - but it doesn't work.  If you have an iPhone 5 - get the cheaper version without the mic / buttons if you must go with UE...<br /><br />UPDATE - 10/08/12 - After about a week of back and forth emails (it takes a full 24 hours for Logitech to respond to each email you send - including those requested by Logitech), I was finally shipped out a fresh set of earbuds.  Hopefully, this set will last a little longer..."	2012-09-24

I got mine in the lilac, but it comes in a few different colored backings which is a nice touch. The reader is very lightweight, easy to hold and easy to read. It doesn't have the backlight like most ereaders do but it gives the most lifelike reading experience there is. It's hell easy to get books using the kobo website, prices are really good too and there are huge selections of books. I'm a horror fan and found it utterly gobsmacking to find so many Richard Laymon & Edward Lee books available!! I also love paranormal romance and teen books which there are more than plenty of. I've even managed to put some books my mother in law emailed me onto the device that are in PDF formats and they are fine to use, but can be a bit fiddly as you have to use the zoom function a lot. Overall the kobo is a top product!!	2012-08-03

It helps of course to get the control signal from about 150° or 160°, compared to the remote's 30°, which is alleviating, but only if u place the black box on the very edge of the shelf of the cabinet and in a capricious position, since the device is not omni receiving, receives just only from two of the sides of the box and from above(?). Far from having a chance to hide the not so small box or place it in the top of another piece of equipment, it has to be only located at the very edge of the cabinet.<br /><br />Got a solution, which lets me control my Marantz receiver and it makes me happy, but doesn not do it in the league a $100 extensor should.<br /><br />It is beautifully manufactured, just wish it was more effective.<br /><br />But glad i had an option for it, since my receiver would be totally inoperative without it.<br /><br />I does the job, but could do it better.<br /><br />Glad -again- anyway.<br /><br />My Sony BDP370, which is a $100 bluray player, gets the signal from the remote from anywhere in the room. Same room, same cabinet.<br />The SR7005 costs about $1500. Plus the $100 IR extensor.<br />Marantz...i think u can copy that.	2012-07-25

Before this i had not any experience in home teather or any hi-fi product. I just bought this because my wife and i saw the demo at Best Buy and it seemed really great!. When i arrive home and setup all the components (including ps3 connection via optical audio) i tested first with music from the ps3 (mp3 and aac files at 320 kbps and normal CD's) and what a disappointment!!!!!!! music sound detailed in highs and lows but immediately i felt something was missing, like the body of the music with all songs i tested.<br />Then tested with movies, in this field the sound improved a lot but the thing is i wanted to use this more for listening music (70%) than watching movies (30%). So if you want to be thrilled with the sound of your music i think you must look for something else, im not saying it sounds like crap, but after six months i bought a Harman/Kardon avr1600 with HKTS20bq speakers and although it is a entry level system it sound better with both music and movies, so i moved the Bose to a secondary location and made the HK combo my main home teather system.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Made for people who don't want to know anything about wires, bulky speakers or specific audio setups.<br />- Small and attractive design<br />- Good for movies<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Music does not sound rich.<br />- for what you pay you can buy better amplifier and speakers (entry level)<br />- Does not recognize DTS Master Audio and Dolby True HD<br />- Limited audio input connections<br /><br />After a year of experience i could say im sure that i won't buy again a Bose.	2011-11-21

However, searching the web comes up with 12V, 7.0Ah to 8.0Ah batteries.  Well, I thought that this is a no brainer.... I want the 10Ah, has it held a longer charge for the same given size.  Oops, I was wrong.  The extra capacity came in at the expense of the battery's height.  This battery is slightly taller (4.4 inches) than the stock battery (3.9 inches).  While there is plenty of space to mount the taller batteries, the bracket that secured them in place used screws that are now too short.  After a quick trip to the hardware store for longer screws, everything is back in place, works great and holds its charge.  I would purchase these batteries again, but I only wish:  1) They came with the 2 longer screws needed to secure the batteries in place or made it clear the battery was 1/2 inch taller and that I would need new screws.  2) They would provide the harness that mates to the quad to make the installation easier.  PS: Please be aware that you'll need to unsolder or cut the wire harness from the old batteries in order to keep the connector that plugs into the quad.  They only provide the terminals that connect to the battery.... not the quad.	2011-11-07

I run ~5 miles per run and work out at the gym as well.<br /><br />The JLABShad superior fit and sound quality *but* they had a tendency to fall out during runs and sweat and ear gunk eventually made the sound quality suffer. In short they, along with most other in ear headphones weren't designed to handle the humidity and shock of working out.<br /><br />What makes these a bit different is that they have a small port for the sound to come out of, which means they are mostly plastic with a silicon fitting to for \\\\\"comfort\\\\\". Well, not so much. You'll really have to try all the accessory fittings to get the right one, and after that, will have to figure out how to get the things in your ears so you can get a reasonable bass response from them.  Until that happens, they will seem tinny at first.<br /><br />In all, I'm happy for a sub $30 pair of headphones and run well with me. However, if you listen to music that doesn't have electronic bass (like Hip Hop or electronic) you'll hear your music be a bit crunchy, but clear."	2011-08-08

Superior sound and high-quality construction with aluminum bodies for under $70 delivered to my door.  Great!<br /><br />Now that I have had a chance to listen to the NFs and wear them on a few walks, I must say, I am not disappointed.<br /><br />I would compare their sound quality to the Klipsch Image buds, but I think the NuForces are less susceptible to those intrusive and annoying rustling noises when the wires move as you walk.  In large part, this may be due to the little clip NF has included, which you can clip to your collar and help stabilize the wires.  I believe the NF wires are also a little beefier than the very slight and flimsy Klipsch wires.<br /><br />As with the Klipsch and other ear buds, you must make sure to insert these all the way into your ear canals to achieve proper bass and mid range response.  NF gives you two pairs of each of three sizes of rubber ear piece; I found the smallest size gave me the best fit.<br /><br />These ear buds also stay in my ears better than the Sony's -- though I haven't taken them jogging, they have not fallen out when I've gone out for a brisk walk or been juggling packages or whatever.  Again, I think the collar clip helps keep them in place.<br /><br />The isolation from outside noise is quite good; I find myself popping the buds out of my ears when talking to sales clerks in stores.  Again, the collar clip keeps the buds from falling to the floor, a major convenience.<br /><br />I listen to all types of music, and the NFs sound fine on everything from classical to rock.  I also like the way they look, with their simple, modern bullet shape.  A little red collar where the wire enters the bud identifies the right channel bud at a glance, another useful feature.<br /><br />Finally, the NFs give you a little velvet carrying pouch, rather like the Sony's.  Personally I prefer the little cord reel case Sennheiser uses, but I find these pouches easier to deal with than the fussy little tin case with cutouts for the buds and cord favored by Klipsch.<br /><br />At any rate, those looking for ear buds with high-quality sound and construction at a reasonable price should check out these NuForces.  I think you will be very pleased.lly, the NFs give you a little velvet carrying pouch, rather like the Sony's.

First to know me a bit I am a producer (5 years) on a search for headphones that can really satisfy my needs and let me tell you, I am VERY, VERY pleased with the Denon AH-D2000's. Your probably wondering why It took me 5 years to purchase headphones? well I never had time or the money to make my move and I wanted to buy no ordinary headphones, but one I can keep for a good while till I have enough money and experience to start making my collection. I produce House Music, Trance, Electronica, Rock and sometimes Hip Hop beats, but mostly I am all on the Electronic Genre. As you might assume I'm looking for a good punchy bass and for my hats and snares to sound very real and crisp, I really do feel like everything I listen to has way more definition then before. I haven't got a chance to break into them yet, because It's only been about 3 hours but they do deliver right off the bat. The marked price is $350, but like most customers I did purchase them here on Amazon for $220, that being said I can see myself possibly buying these for $300, but no higher, because they are not OMG WOW, but they are close and for the price I paid for I would give them a 6 star rating If I can ..heck, 10? Aside from the pros, the cons..well honestly the only one I can point out is that I wish they were a tad louder, BUT that can just be me because I do like my music very loud so I can really get into it while I produce (But they sound superb). Also I don't think I need to mention this sense everyone else covered it already, but why not have another honest opinion? they are C-O-M-F-O-R-T-A-B-L-E. I can wear these in a 6/8 hour session without even knowing I still have them on. I do not agree on how some people say they are bulky and heavy, They feel rather light and Denon made them look really cool for the size they pulled off. So For the price, quality, sturdiness, sound, structure and even the sleek sexy looks this baby has, it was an excellent purchase. these will not be my only pair, but one of my favorites.<br /><br />**Also I still have not had full time to play with these to its full advantage, this is based solely at the moment of arrival, anyways hope this review helped people like me. :)<br />-Kennie Andrews, 21 years old.o For the price, quality, sturdiness, sound, structure and even the sleek sexy looks this baby has, it was an excellent purchase. these will not be my only pair, but one of my favorites.    **Also I still have not had full time to play with these to its full advantage, this is based solely at the moment of arrival, anyways hope this review helped people like me. :)  -Kennie Andrews, 21 years old.	2010-12-23

Works great but one thing to know.  (also Fragile).	"If you have a new Macbook from April 2010+, and are looking for an adapter for HDMI W/ audio THIS IS THE ONE.  I spent 30 minutes looking through Amazon to make sure it would be the right one, so let me save you the trouble and say it is!<br /><br />Make sure you go to settings and switch audio to \\\\\"HDMI out\\\\\".<br /><br />Now the problem... It's not a problem with this product at all (thus the 5 star rating).  The Macbook won't control the volume with the keyboard through HDMI out, you have to control it from the TV/Monitor/external speakers.  Not sure why, I guess that's just how Digital audio works.  This was a surprise to me, so I wanted to let you all know that.<br /><br />The audio sounds fantastic!<br /><br />Edit 6 months later:<br />I had to replace it (see my comment) already.  I was transporting it back and forth only a few times and it just stopped working.  I replaced it, it's been about 3 months so far.  No problems.  If it remains working for a while I will put it back up to 5 stars, but it seems I am not the only one with this problem of it lasting.  Still it is far cheaper than the Apple version.<br /><br />Edit 1 year later:<br />Taking another star off.  I think I have to replace it already, it shorts out on an hourly basis now.  When a phone rings it will either mess with the picture or go totally to black.  I am disappointed with the fact that I'll have to buy one every 6 months at this rate<br /><br />Edit 2 or so years later:<br />I kept the one from above, it would have intermittant trouble but it was mostly good.  It just died (see comment).  2 stars now.  If you're thinking about buying this, honestly buy two.  It's still pretty cheap, and you'll have an extra for when the first inevitably fails.  I am not really sure there are other options out there in this price range.  If you do buy something else, make sure it sends audio out, about 4/5 of all the adapters don't seem to."	2010-12-13

First of all, it came with NO instructions whatsoever, other than a sheet showing \\\\\"plug mic here\\\\\".  Much of it is intuitive, but no matter what we did, there was no volume to the mic input.  If you stuck the mic halfway down your throat and someone was listening to the speaker with the cone inside their ear, they might hear the vocal.  Naturally I suspected that the mic inputs might be nonstandard or require a pre-amp, so the specs should say so.  Uh, what specs?  Do they cost extra?  Remember, this junkbox came with NOTHING.  Well after forgetting it for a year, holiday season 2010 rolls around and I'm thinking hmm, maybe a pre-amp might work.  So I bought one, and it does what it's supposed to do... it's actually possible to get a decent vocal, but you have to push the buttons randomly until it just happens.  There's a button labeled \\\\\"Karaoke\\\\\".  Well duh.  If I had a button in my car labeled \\\\\"Car\\\\\", I'd wonder what it was for.  Well when I push it, the microphone squeals with horrible feedback.  Nothing makes my day like 110 db of feedback, and the dog freaking out while I'm cussing at myself for even touching this thing when it should have been in the dumpster a year ago.  When you push the buttons on the front console, the display lights up \\\\\"invalid key\\\\\".  When I push most of the buttons on the remote, it says \\\\\"invalid key\\\\\".  I imagine it's a mode thing, let's go check those... oh dang, NO INSTRUCTIONS.  The other interesting thing is when I bought the thing last year, I couldn't even find any mention of it on line, it was as if it didn't exist.  Guitar Center even disowned knowledge of the brand.  What's wrong with this picture?  The good part is, I can get my money back for the pre-amp, and I will post a nice video of the destruction of this pile of junk on youtube.  Not getting my money's worth, but I will never, ever, ever buy this company's products again and I hope as many people as possible are forewarned.  Just because it's in a box and says it does something doesn't mean it really does.  I can do better karaoke with a boom box and a mic on my guitar amp.  A dreadful product, totally unsupported, badly designed, undocumented, flaky... I can go on but you get the idea."	2010-12-12

The J3 has lived up to essentially all my expectations.      The user interface is built much like Apple's ipod touch, with App-like thumbnails that also scroll over to utilities (with the 2.10 firmware).  This more or less combats the confusion most (including me) had to complain about the D2.  The buttons are quite intuitive and easy to figure out.  However, the manual that comes with the J3 says essentially nothing (not a surprise... considering how much frustration I had figuring out the D2).  This is sort of a setback since almost all the buttons are symbols, such as +, or X, etc.  However, no one can deny how much simpler Cowon has made its UI.     The sound quality of the built-in speakers is great! (not quite awesome, but that's ok) I expected something just a bit better than that of a cell phone.  However, these speakers have been so much better than that!  The sound is clean and suffers little loss as compared to that of earphones.  I later plugged the J3 into some other speakers and then it sounded muffled.  I am not sure if this was because the built-in speakers were better or the J3 doesn't handle other speakers too well.  I believe its a little of both.  For those who listen to classical though, I would warn that the maximum volume of the J3 for the speakers will be more or less the needed volume.  You will not be able to overcome much white noise (which I would consider an unlikely situation for those who listen to classical music anyway).      Picture quality is nice.  I'm not as good at telling how good picture quality can get because that's not my thing, but I can assure you that they are decent, especially on the larger screen (from D2 anyway).  The J3 takes a moment to load after sliding over the picture though, so I wouldn't consider it the ideal picture viewer.  Also, if there are too many pictures per folder, you'll have to take a while finding the picture, so don't put too many in one place.  Finally, make sure you upgrade your firmware to at least 2.10 before viewing pictures, b/c my J3 froze at one point while viewing pictures (which Cowon claims to have fixed in the 2.10 firmware).  I pressed the reset button and everything worked out fine, but was still a little scare there.     Videos I don't really know anything about and haven't really tried.  The screen is more or less the size of an itouch, so you go figure.  The jetaudio system takes about four times as long to convert a video.  I don't really convert videos often, so I can't tell you how good that is.  I used to use SUPER for the D2, anyway, for this I can only provide some facts.     Documents I have some complaints about.  I'm not sure if the J3 developers were involved in the D2, because the J3 can only certain pieces of Chinese that my D2 once was entirely fine with.  Basically, the titles would all be fine, saying for example \\\\\"ÖÐ¹ú»°\\\\\" and then once you click into it, the text would all be al;skjfdoiwethwroghlhdfoawutoha (I don't know how to type gibberish, so this is the closest I can get).  I always used text for lyrics.  I have sent something to Cowon, still waiting for a response and hoping for a firmware upgrade.  (Btw, the same thing goes for the titles of music.  Works fine in the browser but unreadable once opened.)  I don't know how the J3 is for other languages, but I would assume more or less the same except Korean.      The jetaudio didn't have the \\\\\"default\\\\\" settings but rather three users that could change settings independently.  I basically took my D2 and copy pasted, otherwise (if you're not pro at this) you'll just have to test things out.  I've already tweaked w/ my D2, so I can't paste the default settings here.      Don't use the J3 for games.  That's all I can say.  It wasn't made for games, use some other system.  Otherwise you'll have plenty of complaints against the game (I wish there actually were an \\\\\"s\\\\\").      As a side note, the clock took me a while to figure out, and I still haven't found out how I made it work...  It seemed either to be lagging or not moving, so if that happens, try switching between clock and alarm so that the changed time is not highlighted in blue anymore on the \\\\\"clock\\\\\" page."	2010-07-02

Needed something small to fit inside of my carry on bag that had some bass.    Went to an electronic store to try out a couple of portable speaker systems.  Boy there are a lot to choose from, but you can't beat the quality of sound in this price range ($39.99).   I am very impressed with how well this little box fills the room with music.  The bass response is quite good as long as you keep the volume at a suitable listening level (about 75%).  I would not try to throw a party with it, but it is perfect for some dinner time jazz or a casual evening outside with a few friends.   If you are looking for something portable with a clock, I would strongly recommend the Memorex - Compact Travel Speaker System for Apple® iPod® - Black.    The cost was $59.99.   If you are looking for higher quality sound, you can't beat the iHome - Portable Speaker System for Apple iPhone and iPod - Black Model: iP46B | SKU: 9827701 ($99.99).

The sound quality is amazing. I was able to plug in an sd card that is in my cell phone. I put play lists on the device itself and I have discographies on the sd. I didn't need a \\\\\"preloaded\\\\\" card like they say.     There is no cover for the sd slot but the slot is very small. Once I put the card in the slot is completely covered. I'm not too worried about anything getting in it. There's no cover for the computer cord slot either.     I also DID NOT have to download rapsody. I just used windows media player which is my favorite music to device program. I hate itunes and zune, so I'm really happy! The device does come with a card/warning that says you should use rapsody if you want all the features on your device to work but this device only plays music there's no video or anything so I don't think that's true.    The red is glittery. It's just black all over except for the front (I really don't get why the black is more). My contacts are dry and it's pretty late but it almost looks purple, maybe burgundy or magenta. It's not masculine at all, hope this doesn't offend anyone. Like it almost looks... dark pink. It gets smudged REALLY easily. It's kind of gross. I'll live though you should see my ipod.    The clip is NOT removable. I read a review that someone took off the clip to put on a silicon case, there's no way you could do that.    It's smaller than the screen on my ipod video (60 GB ipod \\\\\"classic\\\\\"). It's very light weight. I have to admit it felt cheap when I finally got it out of the annoying packaging sandisk put it in. It packs a punch though, great sound quality and the screen is really nice. Someone said the LED burns out but I'm not worried because the screen turns off once you pick a song and let it run it's course. It does light up non-stop when it's plugged in to your computer though, this is really annoying."	2010-04-29

To download your videos, unscrew the middle of the pen, where you will find a USB plug. Plug it into your computer. The computer should respond by giving you a message saying,\\\\\"New hardware found\\\\\", give the computer a minute and it should say,\\\\\"hardware installed and ready to use\\\\\".    Go into \\\\\"my computer\\\\\"and open the external drive.  Find the file named \\\\\"record,\\\\\" click on it and a file named \\\\\"video\\\\\" should appear.    Click on this to view your videos.  (You probably already have Windows video software preloaded on your computer.)    Once you have done this, the next time you plug it in a menu will appear, click on \\\\\"play\\\\\" to play back your videos!    To charge the pen, take the usb cable and plug the slimmer end into the the charger. Unscrew the pen and attach the thicker end into the pen's USB plug. Insert the charger into an outlet and you will charge the pen. Charge for a few hours, then unplug the thicker end of the USB cable from the pen and screw the pen back together.          Good luck.

I decided on the CM 3010 and bought Channel Master's chimney mount kit and mast.  I bought the mast from an Amazon Associate and was not pleased with the packing because they didn't put enough tape on the ends and when I received the package one end was open (probably from the mast ramming the end of the box during shipping).  The only thing in the box was the mast and I don't know if anything fell out.  But it was a mast so how much more could there have been in there?<br /><br />The antenna requires some assembly but it isn't too difficult as the instructions are fairly clear.<br /><br />I installed this antenna right next to a satellite antenna I installed using a similar chimney mounting kit.  I'm about 25 miles from the most of the broadcast towers in the area and I just pointed it in the right direction using a Silva compass.  The 3010 is light and not too hard to handle so I'd say it's reasonable for someone to install it without helpers (I did).<br /><br />The cable attaches to the bottom so a good connector probably makes a difference and it is sealed by a weather boot which will be hard to put on if the cable has a connector on it.  I ran some RG6 coax to the antenna, slipped on the boot then attached an LRC connector to the cable.  No problem if you have the tools and parts.  After that I just had to screw the connector on and slide the boot into position.<br /><br />If someone is concerned about appearance it is a nice antenna because it isn't too big and doesn't have much of an antenna look.  Sitting next to the sat dish it doesn't stand out.  If it's mounted low it won't stand out much because of it's flat profile.<br /><br />The resulting television picture is very nice with good signal strength.  I have not noticed any problems with reception (except in the case when I tried it with an inexpensive DTV adapter box and the problem there was probably the adapter itself because it isn't all that great with any antenna I've tried).  Great reception when the 3010 is attached to a Channel Master 7000 adapter box.  It's a VHF/UHF antenna so there are no issues with high and low band VHF (it covers 2 through 69 so that's the full range, but note it's range is 30 miles for UHF and 45 miles for VHF/FM).  Someone I know who lives about 10 miles from the broadcast location has the same antenna and reported great performance.<br /><br />Although it doesn't seem to perform noticeably better than the twenty year old Winegard UHF/VHF/FM antenna in the attic, it consumes a LOT less space.  I like it enough I'm considering purchasing a second one with an eave mount rather than mess with a distribution amp.<br /><br />If someone is having problems with a 3010 at distances of less than 30 miles from the towers and with minimal tall structures in the line-of-sight that might be causing multipath interference I suggest checking the wiring of the \\\\\"wings\\\\\" onto the circuit board in the body of the antenna.  If those receiving elements weren't connected when it was assembled performance will suffer.  And if the connector wasn't installed on the cable with a coax stripper and a compression/crimp tool that matches the connector it might be good to check that part of the cable.d).

If someone is having problems with a 3010 at distances of less than 30 miles from the towers and with minimal tall structures in the line-of-sight that might be causing multipath interference I suggest checking the wiring of the \\\\\"wings\\\\\" onto the circuit board in the body of the antenna.  If those receiving elements weren't connected when it was assembled performance will suffer.  And if the connector wasn't installed on the cable with a coax stripper and a compression/crimp tool that matches the connector it might be good to check that part of the cable."	2009-09-29

I had owned a Creative Zen Sleek Photo before I decided to purchase this, my Zen Sleek Photo was an excellent MP3 player, and in fact is still completely functional, but I managed to screw up the headphone jack, and now the sound cuts out whenever it moves, which is nearly constantly for any sort of walking or other kind of even moderately active listening. This did not jive with my usual listening habits, so I looked into purchasing a new MP3 player, and found that Creative had come out with something new, and incredibly visually appealing (in my opinion).     When I first received my new Creative Zen I was so happy, I liked the way it looked, I loved the way it sounded, it was my favorite MP3 player I had ever owned until, about 97 days after I had purchased it, it died. Wouldn't turn on, screen would flash white when I plugged it into the USB port on the computer, and I got informed by Creative that it was only covered in a 90-day labor warranty. This is an unacceptable warranty, I did some looking, and the only ones I could find were the iPod, and the Zune that had a one year warranty.	2009-09-21

This thing is absolutely awesome.  I can access nearly any radio station in the world, access my Rhapsody account, all of my MP3's, and a whole bunch of other services.  I can't believe what's available and how well thought out this device is.      I have a friend who has a Sonos and I really wanted one until I tried the Boom.  I can take this on the deck, the garage, in the front yard or anywhere else in the house without having my home theatre or computer on.  I can also listen to all of this through the online portal on my PC at work.    It's expensive but worth every cent.  Great sound quality, endless variations of stuff available, great support and easy setup.  This is my favorite gadget ever and I buy lots of gadgets!    Update - 02/21/2009 I added a small 50 watt subwoofer to the Squeezebox Boom and it takes the sound from great to amazing.  The more I use the boom, the more I like it.	2009-02-08

Got this to go with the LUCID Folding Foam Mattress that folds up like a small couch. The mattress is very sturdy and provide ample cushioning for lying on the floor, even for a big guy, but I had a visitor who had knee problems and getting up and down on the floor proved very difficult, irritating his knee. So next visit I bought this bi-fold bed and I'm happy to say it worked out perfectly.<br /><br />It's easy to open and close (you have to undo the screw to affix the braces at the four corner legs, but it a wing nut, so very easy and it is really compact. I have a small apartment and didn't find it difficult to find a place to store it. It's sturdy--supposed to take up to 1,200 lbs. And it definitely gives that impression when you lie on it (I tried it out first to make sure it felt stable).<br /><br />The cushion slid around on the metal, but I solved that problem by laying a blanket over the frame and then putting the cushion on top which gave it a nice skirt around the bed hiding the legs. My guest was a big guy, 5'11&#34;, 200+ lbs, and he was very comfortable on it. I would have liked the frame to be a bit longer, but I haven't seen any longer than this (this is about the longest I found) and given the low price it was a bargain. My guest used it for 5 nights with no complaints of instability or discomfort (and believe me he would have said something).<br /><br />Highly recommend this for a temporary sleep solution for visitors. The item ships fast, is packed well. There were no missing pieces, really the only pieces are just the screws to put the brackets in place. My only complaint is it would have been nice if the design included some sort of clamp to hold the bed together when folded. It also can be a little awkward opening it, but not too much. Also the legs have plastic foot that didn't scratch my wood floor at all. Of course I was careful, but if the legs had been sharp at the ends at all they definitely would have scratched the floor.<br /><br />Allin all, this is a great bargain and good solution for short-term guests.	2015-07-16

For the price, this chair is far from worth it. I received it as a gift and the chair was completely unlevel, which took a few weeks of sitting to really become noticeable. Once that was obvious though, it explained many of the issues I had been having since getting the chair, namely ulnar nerve pain. How terribly unlevel mine was could have just been a production mistake, but that wasn't the worst part of the chair sadly.<br /><br />The shape resembles that of an airline chair as far as the contour goes, which are some of the least ergonomic chairs out there. I found there was a severe lack of lumbar support, and the headrest was much more of a head pushing machine, causing you to be forced into an awkward forward lean.<br /><br />The one good thing about this chair was the tilt and adjustable tension, but it in no way could make up for the other issues.	2015-01-20

We have laminate flooring, they slide across the floor so easily I am afraid I'll fall, since i am big and a little unsteady.  Slamming the footrest back is also a challenge, although getting easier.

"We purchased this \\\\\"desk of drawers\\\\\" as a gift for my dad on Father's Day. I have since returned it for a refund. The positives: The packaging was stellar and the drawer fronts seemed decently made upon inspection. The negatives: As a frequent Ikea shopper, I have tons of experience assembling furniture...this was in no way similar to assembling a well-engineered Ikea piece. 1st, there were a million pieces, which was expected, but still slightly daunting, considering how small it is. 2nd, it sits on leveling legs and 2 of them were missing. 3rd, about 50% of the holes, which were supposed to already be drilled, were not drilled...some of those holes were the ones that locking plate things were intended to go in, not simple screw holes. Often, the existing holes did not line up where they needed to. 4th, the hardware that came w/ it was super cheap and pieces kept breaking...my husband had to go to the hardware store to replace those pieces. 5th, after we finally got it together, we couldn't get the bottom, file drawer in because the side of the dresser that the desk pulls out on kept separating when we'd pull out the desk. Absolute garbage. Very disappointed."	2014-07-02

The bed itself is beautiful.  The instructions only provide for two small screws to connect the entire top bed piece to the shelves/drawers below.<br /><br />The whole thing came in 4 boxes via UPS.  There was some mistake and 1 of the boxes was wrong and it delayed the delivery and then finally came 1 week later and was wrong.  I called Amazon and they couldn't just send the one right box and sent another 4 out via FedEx.  That came quickly.  Now, I have been trying to send back the 4 extra/wrong boxes for weeks now.  First, UPS came with only 1 label for the 4 boxes.  Called Amazon.  They said to print repeats of the label from the email and were supposed to set up another UPS pickup.  There was no label in the email.  Another call...sent the same label-less email.  Another call...sent a label.  Another call a few days later when UPS never came revealed that they never called a 2nd time and the label was wrong.  Now they put in 4 separate calls for UPS to come separately to pick up the boxes.  And now with snow on and off, I keep moving the boxes in and out of the garage (some weigh over 100 lbs).  They still haven't come.  Between UPS and Amazon, this has been a nightmare in the delivery/shipping process.	2014-02-19

All the individual parts were available. it took me about 1.5 to 2 hours to assemble manually without power tools...(tried to be very careful). I was pleased with the finished product...it fit the description given online. the only thing I was not too pleased with was the back; i wonder why it was two pieces/sheets instead of a single sheet.

Based on previous positive experiences, a French press produces a significantly better taste in a normal cup of coffee.<br />The steps we took were as follows ;<br />1. Coarsely grind the coffee beans (they come whole)<br />2. Measure out 2 tbsp for every 6 oz of coffee<br />3. Bring (we used bottles) water to just under a boil<br />4. Allow 4 minutes for the brewing process for best results<br /><br />Here's my actual review.<br /><br />Honestly, it's like that of a nice cup of coffee..smooth, and not as bitter as a regular cup of joe.<br /><br />Pros<br />• bold, fresh taste<br />• no acidic taste left in the mouth in comparison to others<br />• smoother than your &#34;average joe&#34; (haha)<br /><br />Cons<br />• not worth the $80<br />• smooth, but not as smooth and heavenly as described by other reviewers<br />• not much, if at all better, than a specialty cup you would purchase at your average commercial coffee shop<br /><br />Overall, it definitely makes for a nice cup of coffee. Would I taste it and ask, &#34;wow! This is exquisite! Where did you buy this?&#34; Well, no. It's really not worth $80 if you're looking for an &#34;out-of-this-world&#34; flavor. However, I have 110% respect for how it's produced. At the very least, it's certainly a conversational piece, even though you'll be paying out the ass for it. Just be sure to mention where it comes from AFTER you let your friends drink it.	2015-07-25

It's real milk, specially heat-treated (like super-Pasteurization) so it does not require refrigeration while stored (until you open it and expose it to the air, and then you'll need to refrigerate it like any other milk). No special additives or preservatives are involved, so no worries about chemicals. It's 100% real milk.<br />Parmalat is a famous and trusted brand.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with UHT milk, the cardboard carton is like those we see regular milk or OJ in here in the USA. There's a pop-up or sometimes screw-cap closure. The carton is pretty durable and designed not to leak as months pass.<br />Most Americans discover UHT milk while traveling in Europe. UHT milk is an everyday staple product there, with multiple brands in every supermarket and even the tiniest hole in the wall convenience store. Usually a store will stock more UHT milk than 'fresh' milk.The advantage is it can be stored in its airtight cardboard container without refrigeration for anywhere up to a year.<br />I have some in my pantry now that has July 2015 as a best-by date, and I bought it in August 2014, so that's 11 months.<br />I've opened UHT milk after storing it for nearly a full year, many times-- and it's always been just fine.<br /><br />UHT milk is great for convenience--leave a few quarts in your pantry and you'll always have \\\\\"backup\\\\\" milk for morning coffee, even if you forgot/didn't have a chance to get to the store.<br />For Emergency Preparedness, it's a perfect solution. Whether you are concerned about prolonged power outages, storms, blizzards, hurricanes, earthquakes or whatever, you can always have real milk. You can stockpile as many quarts or gallons' worth of the stuff as you feel the need for.<br />And it is 'real milk', so it's a familiar comfort food if you do have an emergency. When you get close to its 'best-by' date, just open it, use it up instead of the fresh milk you would normally buy, and replace it with more UHT milk with another year's storage life.<br />My cartons contents state 32 grams protein, and lots of potassium, calcium, sugars, fat (varies) and carbs and 500 calories. That's a lot of good food value in a crisis and it only requires a very small storage footprint, even for a supply of many week's worth. These store compactly either upright or on their side.<br /><br />Once opened you can cook and bake with this just like any 'fresh' milk. There's no taste difference between UHT and 'fresh' milk.<br />If you don't like the watery taste of 'powdered milk' (and I don't like it myself), then UHT milk will be a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />I see UHT milk offered in a choice of Whole, 1% and 2% reduced-fat versions. I've never seen it offered in a 'Fat-Free/Skim' version.<br /><br />One brand of UHT milk tastes and performs exactly like every other brand--there's no difference. So you can comparison-shop for price without worrying about taste or longevity (just pay attention to the 'best-by' dates, of course).<br /><br />About the cartons--they seem not to attract gnawing bugs, and I've never had a problem. But it's just a waterproofed cardboard carton, so for a remote cabin type storage you'll want to make sure they're stored somewhere rodent-proof.<br /><br />These are great for storing on boats, or for weekend car camping.<br /><br />Now, about price. Most big American supermarket chains have begun carrying UHT milk (although they can't decide which department to assign it to) at prices that vary wildly, but are usually under $2 a quart (I've seen it as low as $1/quart, which is about the same price as fresh milk). When you buy online (here at Amazon or anywhere else) you are naturally paying a premium for shipping all that weight (milk weighs 2 pounds per quart, 8 pounds per gallon).<br />So of course, if you can find this at a local supermarket, you'll almost certainly be paying a lower priceper quart than having all that liquid weight shipped to your door.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful, especially for those who have not used UHT milk before. It really is great stuff, and a great Preparedness product.per quart than having all that liquid weight shipped to your door.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful, especially for those who have not used UHT milk before. It really is great stuff, and a great Preparedness product."	2014-10-26

The best way I have served them is with a mayo sauce and veg heavy on the mayo,. I made a chipotle esch mayo with Cayenne salt garlic powder and onion i think.. either way it made it very enjoyable.

The shipment arrived within a few days of my order and each pod is individually packaged which is wonderful for keeping each as fresh as the next (not like the Illy tin where once opened all are exposed).  Had to try it right away and the taste was wonderful.  There is no difference when it comes to which side of the pod is the top or bottom.  The pod fit nicely in my FrancisFrancis but I must not have put the holder in tight enough because I went to remove it before all the steam finished and the pod burst on the side but none went into the cup.  I will pay a bit more attention from now on but you live and learn.  Overall, the price cannot be beat for as many as you get and it is very tasty with a nice creama.	2014-08-23

This salsa is just perfect -- it hits the spot for me every time. I love it on Nachos, Quesadillas, to make Guacomole, to add to many dishes, or even straight up with corn chips.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I can't buy it in larger quantities. When I first discovered it, it came in 70oz bottles from Costco. Now I can only find it in these little glass jars. It's still worth it, but I definitely eat so much of this stuff that larger quantities would be more economical.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is the best salsa I've ever had. The best restuarant salsas and fresh artisan salsas sometimes come close, but no other major brand is even in the same league as this stuff. Try it yourself!	2014-04-21

"You will love this, as there is no coconut taste. Personally, I love coconut, but knew from the reading the label that it would not be coconutty.<br />I purchased it at a local specialty grocery store, and one star is removed not for the product, which is EXCELLENT, but for the packaging. I noticed that some of the gold color shrink film had streaks of blue. At first I thought it was to identify 2 different types of coconut vinegar. On close inspection, it looked more like some bottles had leaked.<br /><br />Other than that, I love this stuff. Health and science writer/guru Paul Elsass has the following to say (and says it better than I could), and generously gave permission to quote: \\\\\"The sap used to make coconut vinegar comes from coconut trees grown in volcanic soil rich with minerals. The sap contains phosphorus, potassium, iron, magnesium, sulfur, boron, zinc, manganese and copper. It is especially rich in potassium, containing an impressive 192 milligrams per tablespoon. The Institute of Medicine lists known functions of each mineral in your body. Potassium is important in balancing electrolytes, controlling high blood pressure and metabolizing sugar, while phosphorus works with calcium to build bones and facilitates your body's ability to use other nutrients. Iron is critical for the creation of red blood cells and is essential in the production of cellular energy. In addition to being another component in red blood cell formation, copper is a mineral that will also assist your body with iron absorption. Magnesium is important in nerve and muscle function and is essential in every major biological process in your body.<br />Coconut sap contains all 9 essential amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein, although there are only trace amounts of methionine present. The sap also contains 8 nonessential amino acids. Proteins are part of every living cell in your body. The Nutrition Supplement Education Centre lists many other functions of amino acids, including their importance in the formation of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen, and antibodies, which help your immune system fight infection. Some amino acids play a part in repairing tissue, while others serve as neurotransmitters, transmitting messages within the brain, and some are even utilized in detoxification and metabolic functions.\\\\\"<br /><br />I've used Braggs vinegar for as long as I can remember, and will continue to do so, especially in apple pies, canning spiced apples, pears, and peaches, as well as slow cooked cabbage and apples. This Coconut Secret is a nice addition to the cupboard, wonderful to add a splash to a glass of cold drinking water, or used to sour milk for baking. Also very nice in home cosmetic preparations.including their importance in the formation of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen, and antibodies, which help your immune system fight infection.

Some very good recipes.  However, I'm a single man and my pantry is, well, somewhat basic most of the time.  Krusteaz comes with everything you need to make a great loaf of bread except for water.  And I almost always have that!  If it's not quite to your taste straight out of the box, you can customize it.  I'd also strongly recommend the sourdough.	2014-03-27

I bought these thinking I was going to get at least a dozen flowers for my wife on valentines day. i spent $44 dollars on these including shipping, and after i took them back to the local seller that amazon paid to make these and bring them to i was informed that they only paid 25 dollars to the local florist. And that is exactly what i received the pic shows it could be at least a dozen flowers but i actually only received 6 and it was not full like this pic shows.. It also shows a urn type vase but i received a skinny little face not the urn style in the pic. i will never buy flowers from here again. i suggest if you want an honest price for an arrangement shown in the pic go to a local business and support them. moral of story. even though you pay almost 50 dollars you are actually only receiving a 25 dollar value.RIP OFF	2014-02-13

"We had been on a waiting list for notification when this item came back in stock.<br />Notice received, product ordered.<br />Product arrived yesterday.<br /><br />Now, we had 99+ temps here this week, so I am sure heat played a little factor here.<br />But, the jar was a little oily on the outside, as was the inner seal (greasy/oily on the TOP<br />of the sealed jar). I am going to be nice and blame the hot temps. We wiped everything off,<br />peeled the seal off and took a whiff of some of the most wonderful smelling butter ever!<br />The item came packaged well, so I really don't think it was the shipping. Once the lid was<br />opened up and the actual product got some exposure to inside room temps, it seemed to get a<br />little bit firmer.<br /><br />We quickly got out a roll of crackers to sample this nectar which had arrived at our door.<br />We didn't bother with silly things like knives or spoons, and dipped our crackers right into<br />the butter!  Ha!  It was SO GOOD!<br /><br />My husband is a cashew freak already, and the kids follow closely behind. I have a hard time chewing<br />them, so I never get to enjoy cashews like they did - UNTIL NOW!<br /><br />Now, I admit I thought the jar could have been a little larger. When compared to peanut butter,<br />it seems so small. But, totally different nuts, so totally different jar. I am sure they had their<br />reasons for using this size vs the \\\\\"normal\\\\\" peanut butter sized jar.<br /><br />The taste is creamy and smooth, with truly nice aftertaste of roasted cashews.<br />The ingredients label lists only three things: cashews, macadamia nuts and organic coconut sugar.<br />No weird preservatives, binders, etc etc.  Just fresh nuts with a little natural sweetener.<br /><br />I said \\\\\"Shame on you\\\\\", because now we are hooked on a new product that is not particularly budget-friendly.<br />But, we will definitely be reordering this item.

I currently now live on the East Coast and I have tried every cracker and none taste the same as these. I am not sure how Diamond Bakery does it but these crackers are fantastic...thick, crisp, and smooth---I know that sounds strange but when you try the cracker you will understand what I mean. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to shipping the cracker may break, but that doesn't impact the taste at all. If you try them I hope they will hit the spot!	2012-11-02

We had an Autumn soup party a couple of weeks ago, featuring 3 different soups and different artisan breads.  The overwhelmingly favorite soup was the Illinois Prairie Corn Chowder.  It couldn't have been easier to prepare, and I added absolutely nothing to it (except the fresh corn, as recommended on the package) and it tasted fantastic.  Everyone wanted my soup recipe and were surprised when I revealed that it was an easy to make packaged soup.<br /><br />The package makes a lot of soup, about 12 servings.  Since I had a large group, I made up two packages.  We were able to send extra servings home with our guests, and still had plenty left over for ourselves.<br /><br />I saw a review that suggested adding some cooked bacon to the soup.  I'm going to try that next time, even though the package mix requires no extra flavoring.  I just like the flavor of bacon.<br /><br />I'd recommend this soup to anyone who likes corn, chowder, and a rich tasty soup.	2012-10-25

Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea is great for a quick glass of iced tea.  You don't have to go through the hassle of making a whole pitcher, you can just make one glass at a time.  Very convenient.  Here's how I do it: I keep a bunch of glasses (actually beer mugs) in the freezer and some purified water in the refrigerator.  So, all I have to do is grab a frosty mug, pour in the powdered Yamamotoyama Green Tea powder from its individual packet (there are 20 in a box) and add cold water from the frig.  Stir and drink.

I saw several people blogging about making mozzarella with a $40 cheesemaking kit and thought I should give it a try, but collecting the ingredients on my own.  All you need is Citric Acid (which I found at my local Sprouts in the bulk spices section) for less than a dollar, this box of Rennet, Whole Milk from your local grocery store (I had no problem with the pasteurized milk from Sprouts), salt, strainer and cheese cloth in addition to your stock pot and measuring cups.  The instructions and the recipes in the box worked fabulously for me.  I've made the mozzarella 3 weekends in a row.  It's easy to do, but there is a decent amount of down time while you wait.  PS...the recipe says to store in a salty water.  I found the salt content to be very high and did not enjoy it raw after it sat in the brine more than a day. It was fine for lasagna though. If you are going to eat it the same day, keep it at room temp and serve. It will have the best taste and texture then.  I watched several youtube videos before I made it the first time and it helped me visualize what needed to be done.  Just google how to make mozzarella video.<br />Enjoy!<br />PS. There are tons of recipes included in this box...I'll be trying Feta next.  This box has enough for you to make 16 batches if cheese.	2012-08-09

Not the same Hershey Cocoa it used to be	"I have been buying and using Hershey unsweetened powdered cocoa for over 30 years now.  It was pretty good stuff for the price, and always reliable.  Alas, imagine my dismay to bite into a chocolaty-looking brownie made with the same recipe I've used for years, and taste -- blah.  Blah?  From a BROWNIE?  Gasp!  What was this?  No rich, dark, pungent, distinctly chocolate flavor?  Brown, yes.  Chocolate, barely.  If you'd put a blindfold on me, I'd have been hard put to figure out what I was eating.<br /><br />You know the difference between REAL chocolate and those cheap, waxy brown little fake foil-wrapped abominations you can buy at the discount store to placate the neighborhood trolls every October?  Well, that's the difference between good old reliable Hershey cocoa of yore, and the stuff they're trying to pass off as cocoa now.<br /><br />I was aware that Hershey had removed cocoa butter and other quality ingredients from all their ready-to-eat chocolate products a couple of years ago and replaced them with vegetable shortenings, soy, emulsifiers, and God-knows-what-else.  But I naively thought Hershey cocoa powder had escaped a similar flavor hijacking, chemically-enhanced adulteration.  I was so, so wrong.  The ingredient list says, \\\\\"COCOA.\\\\\"  Trust me, this is NOT the same cocoa it used to be.  And it's so, so wrong what Hershey has done to it.<br /><br />It's sad when an American tradition falls to the greed of a big corporation cutting corners."	2012-03-03

Unfortunately purchasing the tiny 4oz bottles of cinnamon would get very expensive very fast - so when I found this 5lb monster on Amazon I was thrilled to give it a shot.<br /><br />I sprinkle the cinnamon liberally around the perimeter of my house and so far, so good. I live in Texas where fire ants are a pretty big problem - I have seen the ants circumvent the trail of cinnamon on several instances. They do \\\\\"crossover\\\\\" from time to time if there is a food source they're trying to get to, but generally speaking they tend to stay away from the stuff. I have a raised garden bed in my backyard where I also used the cinnamon in combination with food grade diatomaceous earth and together they work pretty well at keeping away the various ground crawlies that like to munch on the tomatoes and cucumbers.<br /><br />The cinnamon solution isn't perfect by any means, but it does work as a deterrent. As a plus, the smell of cinnamon is much nicer than the various toxins in the bug sprays. I do resort to the bug sprays indoors and when the bugs get out of hand outside (ie: mounds everywhere), but it's a start and I do believe that it has cut down on the number of multi-legged invaders. Your mileage may vary, but this 5lb jug is a great price to experiment with."	2011-04-05

The flavor is good; however, 13.5 oz of sauce doesn't go very far.  It isn't as big as jars of sauce are.  Others have pointed out that it also doesn't work well if you like ground beef or ground turkey in your sauce.  So, while it is more convenient in some respects, it has a few drawbacks.  If you're cooking for two, this might do the trick.  But I think it's too little to go much farther than that.	2008-03-22

All prworkout supplements these days seem to claim the same thing, crazy energy with crazy massive pumps that take your work out to the next level. In reality most of them are nothing more than caffine, some sort of creatine, and some type of vascular dialator. Most do not do what the label claims, other than give you energy due to the excessive amout of caffine. The problem is, caffine actually restricts blood vessels. So with an overload of caffine and the vascular dialator combination, the supplements are actually working against one another. One restricting and the other dialating, which one wins, both are proven to do what each supplement claims when taken alone. That's why I like this product, it's not a combination of ten different supplements claiming crazy workouts. Arginine nitrate is the main supplement in these capsules, a proven vascular dialator that allows more oxygen to the muscles. This product list all the ingredients on the back with MGs, unlike other products that just say proprietary complex and do not really tell you what your taking. This product does work better when taken on an empty stomach. I also like that this is a creatine free product, creatine works really well but I prefer not to take it. Take with water 20 to 30 min before workouts and you should notice a difference in the gym. According to WebMd and other websites, arginine has numerous other health benefits other than just helping build muscle. Arginine also has a few negative side effects that may effect some people, so be sure to research all supplements before you take them. Over all, this is a good prework out supplement.	2015-08-13

If I flex my finger, the finger tip comes off the pad.  Therefore it is not practical to sleep with because I flex my fingers in my sleep.

Over 15 years ago, my Dermatologist removed a small brown spot from my skin and diagnosed me with basal cell carcinoma. This was a bit scary to me as I was very young. I am very fair skinned, and suffered from sunburns my entire childhood. On the advice of that doctor, my family has been using Blue Lizard sunscreen products now for almost 15 years. I personally use sport, regular and face, but have used the baby and sensitive formulas on my family.<br /><br />My parents generation didn't believe in using sunscreen. I have been educated the hard way from the harmful effects of the sun, so I know how important it is to prevent them from BIRTH! We have always made sure our kids were properly protected when going out in the sun. That being said, our youngest had a small brown mole on the bottom of her foot from birth. At age 5, the dermatologist began measuring the mole and said eventually it would have to be removed with surgery. At age 8, we went ahead and had it taken off. Now more than ever it is important to make sure that she never has a sunburn. Blue Lizard, when applied properly and according to the package recommendations, is the best sunscreen I have ever used. My daughter uses the sensitive formula because she has very sensitive skin.<br /><br />If these reasons aren't enough, my husband suffers from a sort of sun allergy. The ONLY sunscreen that keeps him from itching after sun exposure is Blue Lizard.<br /><br />It works best if you apply it to dry skin, let it dry before going out in the sun, reapply as needed	2015-04-07

I was not disapointed, the shisha is very flavorful. As soon as I opened the box, the room smelled wonderful!  The aroma is actually quite powerful, it has masked a terrible cat odor I've had for years in the corner from a &#34;nervous&#34; (weak bladder) cat, lol. Not being able to smell that has made this shisha worth it's weight in gold. My favorite would have to be the tropical one with the mango a close second, the strawberry smelled delish but had an artificial taste to it. I have yet to try the apple or pineapple though. I will continue to purchase this in the future for as long as amazon has it offered!	2015-03-29

Then I tried doing a ketogenic diet and found I became very weak during and after the workout. I decided to add in BCAAs and lite salt to attempt to repair and provide electrolytes during exercise. It worked well. So well in fact, sometimes I wonder if I am working hard enough in the weight room. I have never quite felt this way before after weight training. I know I am making gains because I can handle more and more of a load over time. I use BCAAs all of the time now, not just while on keto. I think the difference now is that I am giving my body the opportunity to start repairing itself before it gets wore down and  DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) sets in. I am not saying DOMS has gone totally away, but it's gotten a ton better than it used to be, even when I was 10 years younger than I am now.	2015-03-04

US	31396905	R1IP39U75KWIG7	B00CR0EYZI	751568294	Smilex - The Original Ultrasonic Electric Toothbrush	Health & Personal Care	2	8	10	N	Y	Not convinced, returned.	The short of it is I'm not convinced it really works.<br /><br />The Ultrasonic action - if you say so. I can't tell.  That LED that says it is on sure isn't cleaning my teeth.<br /><br />The Sonic Action - very weak.  Nothing close to sonicare action.  The design of the brush arm really prevents any meaningful action because its basically a solid piece of plastic - how is it going to move, really?  Basically the whole brush vibrates some, and that is supposed to be the sonic action.  If you hold the brush down firmly to a countertop you will see that there isn't really any brush head movement, just ever-so-slight vibration.  So it's not really going to do much.<br /><br />So what is left? Your arm brushing your teeth - which is what they expect you to do anyway.  If you do a good job, then your teeth will be clean.  But you don't need to buy a $150 brush to do that do you?<br /><br />Other design weaknesses:<br />- the battery.  It is NiCad I believe.  It is not Lithium Ion.  This means it won't last as long.  It also seems to require 30 hours for a charge, which is a lot longer than say a sonicare brush.  I didn't want to deal with that every 2 weeks.<br />- the bristles.  They're too tall really.<br /><br />Design strengths:<br />- the heads are cheap, that's good.  Although with only one distributor that may not always be true.<br />- the unit is sealed.  since there are no moving parts, it won't eventually get waterlogged like a sonicare can.<br /><br />The distributor was pleasant to work with.  He worked with me to handle my return.	2015-01-16

Given the cost and emotional hardships of trying to conceive a child through IVF or other methods. This is worth a try.  When my husband and I found out about our fertility issues we were very frantic to buy as many natural supplements that we could find. My husband is on a cocktail of vitamins and I figured, if we could do that then we can spend a few dollars on this and take a risk. We have been using this for about two months have not gotten another semen analysis done. But hopefully this will have a positive impact. My husband has 1% sperm morphology.  Don't forget that it takes for a full three months to  replenish don't expect to be wearing this for one month doesn't get pregnant I'm not sure if it's going to help, but, you know what it's worth a try.

Note that some are dress socks (best for dress shoes) and others are sports socks (sneakers or any sports related shoes cleats etc.).  You could certainly wear the sports socks in a business casual work environment.<br /><br />A bit of background:<br />I wear nothing but compression socks now and forever as recommended by my doctor after getting a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (blood clot in leg vein) earlier this year.  If you have leg circulation issues (Do your legs fall asleep when sitting on a bench for awhile?) (Are your feet/toes constantly cold?), you may want to wear compression socks too.<br /><br />My father always wore “support” socks for work, (which is basically the same thing we call compression socks nowadays) to reduces leg/muscle fatigue.  That’s why athletes also wear compression gear.  As far as I’m aware there are no negatives to wearing compression socks so consider wearing them just for comfort.  (Disclaimer: I am not a doctor so check with one if you have concerns).<br /><br />On to the reviews:<br />Gold Toe Men's Firm Compression Support Over the Calf Dress Sock, Black, Medium ($13.50 Prime)<br />Quality compression sock (Top quality like all Gold Toe socks)<br />Excellent compression<br />Thin dress sock (made for a dress shoe)<br />True knee-high sock<br />Stays up nicely and doesn’t dig in at top<br />Perfect quality after several washes<br />Best quality for the price that I have found<br /><br />Fytto Style 1067 Men's Comfy Travel and Dress Compression Socks, 15-20mmHg, Knee High, Large, Black ($12.60 Prime)<br />Similar to Gold Toe but one notch down in quality<br />Not quite as nice feel as Gold Toe (closer to ladies nylon feel than men’s dress sock)<br />Shows some wear after several washes<br />Less compression than others (15-20mmHg instead of 20-30mmHg like most others on this review list)<br />2nd best quality for the price that I have found<br /><br />Futuro Restoring Dress Socks for Men, Black, Large, Firm (20-30 mm/Hg) ($11.49 Prime - also sold @ Wal Mart)<br />Austin House Flight Socks (Large) (~$12 inc shipping)<br />Cheap compression dress socks (Futuro sold @ Wal Mart)<br />Basically thick ladies nylons (not so nice)<br />Slippery in shoe (nylon)<br />Decent compression<br />True knee-high sock<br />Stays up reasonably well (falls only a few times a day)<br />Digs in a bit at top band of sock (helps sock fall down less but can be uncomfortable)<br />Quality fades after several washes<br /><br />Terramed Organic Cotton Graduated compression Men's Socks Dress Travel Performance Stockings (20-30 mmHg) (X-Large, White) ($24.99 Prime)<br />Nice soft cotton feel (they are indeed cotton).<br />Good compression.<br />Thin sock (but not too thin)<br />Runs small – buy the next size up. (I purchased M or L for all other brands but XL for Terramed – based on other accurate reviews that these socks run quite small)<br />Constantly fall down - Not Knee high - Too short for me (and I’m not tall only 5’8”) – Even though XL size, sock doesn’t fully rise past calf therefore are constantly falling down to my ankles.<br />After a few washes, they seem to have lost some of their elasticity and fall down even more now.<br />Overall – Great feel but based on socks constantly falling to ankles, I will attempt to return these socks.  They need to be taller and need to somehow figure out how to make elasticity last longer (maybe a couple % less cotton and more spandex)<br /><br />Vitalsox Patented Performance Graduated Compression Socks, White, Large ($17.29 - $33 Prime depending on color (white is $20.21)<br />(Seems to be very similar to Travelsox and Eurosocks brands found on Amazon)<br />Sports style (a bit thicker than dress sock and much more cotton-like feel)<br />7 color choices – even purple if that’s your thing!<br />Italian made (ooh ahh)<br />Excellent quality<br />Excellent compression<br />Soft feel (close to cotton feel)<br />Stays up nicely<br />Quality holds after several washes<br />I highly recommend (for sport style socks)<br /><br />Jobst Compression Socks – Rolls Royce of compression socks… get them if you can afford to!

Jobst socks are very expensive but worth it especially if you can get medical insurance reimbursement (Doctors orders). (Price ranges from $26-$75 depending on variety)<br />Jobst “Relief” socks are not the same quality as Jobst “Medical” socks and cost half as much but are just fine if you can’t get insurance reimbursement.<br />Great compression<br />Relief socks feel much more like thick ladies nylons than Medical, which feels like a fancy dress sock.<br />Available in wide variety (thigh high, knee high, open or closed toe)<br />I prefer the open toe, knee high Medical sock and I wear a standard sock over them.<br />For long flights, I ONLY use my Jobst socks.<br />I’ve washed my Jobst socks several times and they still appear to be new indicating they might last forever!<br /><br />Jobst also makes a thick cotton-like sports sock called “ActiveWear”.  These are fantastic socks as well but note that they are much thicker than other sports style compression socks.  If you want thinner sports style socks then go with Vitalsox/Eurosocks.<br /><br />Bottom line:  The Jobst are without a doubt the best but crazy expensive so I only have a few of them and ALWAYS wear them on flights.

I originally used these tablets to cure my SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) within a few days, but I have also used these tablets to fight candida. They are great for food poisoning. I will be taking them with me on my trip to Thailand.<br /><br />The active ingredient in these tablets is berberine, a compound that is used in a lot of naturopath antibacterial/antifungal preparations. I have tried American brands (Swanson, Integrative Therapeutics, Metagenics) but these are the best. They seem to kill stomach bugs like no other.<br /><br />These tablets are a little different from American supplements in that they come in narrow tubes that fit 12 tablets each. I generally take 3-4 tablets for stomach problems, but I have taken an entire tube (12 tablets) in times of severe stomach distress. The only downside is they have a bitter taste, but the potency is worth it!<br /><br />UPDATE: Used these on a trip to Thailand and didn't get food poisoning once! Even ate from the sketchy food stalls. These are awesome!	2014-09-03

It helps keep your shoe from putting pressure on the tendon, which causes pain.  It has a gel sort of back which massages the tendon, and helps reduce/retain swelling.  I wore it most work days for quite a few months, now only on occasion when a lot of walking is required.  Someone else suggested to make sure your sock goes up higher than the support, which I have done with a thin knee high (thicker than a stocking, thinner than a sock) and this worked well.	2014-07-23

I picked up [[ASIN:B00GY61ICS Dawn Platinum]] late in 2013 and after 3 months I've used less than Dawn Original and my dishes, silverware, glasses, mugs pots and pans all very clean. BUT my hands are getting dried out when I use it.<br /><br />I don't use an automatic dishwasher, just the two manual ones at the end of my arms!<br /><br />During the winter I like to use my [[ASIN:B00DG08KJO Slow Cooker]]. Anyone who is a slow cooking fan knows it can be a challenge to clean the pot or crock used. Using Dawn Ultra for Soaking loosens stubborn food considerably in a couple of hours. I think it is not quite as effective as Dawn Platinum but still an effective soak.<br /><br />The scent of Dawn Ultra Original Scent is not unpleasant and is mild. Platinum's scent is more mild and for me less is better.<br /><br />Both Dawn Ultra and Platinum require less product than Original in my experience. Less frequent purchases save shopping time and money. Both a plus.<br /><br />The biggest differences for me between Dawn Ultra and Platinum are Platinum drying out my hands  and Platinum may be better for soaking.  In the summer when I'm not soaking as much I think Dawn Ultra is the best choice. Less drying out for the hands. In winter it's much closer. Ultra is a bit better as a soak.<br /><br />I think Dawn Platinum and Ultra are very close in terms of cleaning. Both are an improvement over Dawn's Original formula dish washing liquid and worth a try.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.	2014-07-23

I lost 8 lbs. in three weeks on this program.  I heard about it through my trainer and I just thought this would jump start me on losing the last 15lbs. of baby weight I had.  Honestly, I was skeptical because I &#34;thought&#34; I was eating healthy already.  I gave it a try (I purchased Breakfast, Lunch and Dinners only) and I have to say that I was IMPRESSED!  The first 5-7 days was hard, but once you get through that it is a breeze!  It really showed me that I only thought I was eating all the right things.....but I was eating a lot in between.  I lost 8lbs. and my body is leaner than before I had my THREE kids!  The breakfast is my favorite.  Overall I am surprised but how tasty this food really is. Some of the chicken I do not like, but everyone is different so try everything.  It has taught me a lot about eating the right things and making the right choice.  Even when we eat out I know now what I should or should not choose.  I just placed my second order for the all protein option.  Can't wait!  Terrific product and totally worth the money.

Not only is this a much more pure form of protein, I find that it blends easier than any other whey protein powder I have used in the past. I just dump a scoop of powder into my blender bottle, top it off with a small amount of water, and give it a few shakes and I'm good to go.<br /><br />With other powders, I needed more water (or milk), more shaking, and still didn't always get a properly blended drink. The &#34;flavorless&#34; taste takes some getting used to but it's much better than the cheap chocolate or vanilla flavoring you get with other products. As for the NOW Foods brand, they are my go-to for many other vitamins and supplements. They are always great quality at a very affordable price.	2013-11-15

When we purchased the tilt chair we also received a standard &#34;overbed&#34; table, but that does not work for us at all because the table's base interferes with his wheelchair wheels.  I ordered another overbed table from Amazon but that was not as described and was no better than the one we already had - so we returned it.  This one does work with his wheelchair wheels, and the base is very sturdy, but the table top wobbles.  Another problem is that the table raises automatically whenever you pull the table top up (even when you are not pressing the handle that is supposed to raise it).  Some people might like that but I find it a bit disconcerting.  We are keeping this table because I don't want to take it apart and return it and have to start searching all over again, I guess it is better than nothing. FYI, Sammons Preston has a table that seems to be just perfect for wheelchair users, but it is extremely pricey - I am a little sorry I didn't just order that one in the first place. You might want to check it out.	2013-10-28

Why now?  After two total knee replacement ('09 & '11) and a right rotator cuff surgery in '10, I notice my strength has deteriorated. Prior to my surgeries I was able to one-arm dumbbell press 50# ten times with ease, now I can do barely one.  Part of it due to old age and part babysitting grandkids (lack of lifting).<br /><br />Why five stars?  Read the Amazon reviews and taste tested it with plain water.  Also, did a little research on using this product.  Gained a lot of weight during this period ('09 to '13), 160 to 185#'s.  Lost 10 so far but hope to come down more.  Most says to take Creatine with dextrose or sports drink, but I intend to stick w/plain water.  Will do an update a month from now.<br /><br />UPDATE:  11/12/2013  Appears my strength is coming back.  In short - great product.  Also, check out this link:  [...]	2013-10-08

First it is made of steel with a chrome plate, which will no last very long, chrome is effected by most chemicals in that the human body give off and then it starts rusting. The spot welds are not well made and some spots have burrs that require some filing or it will cause cuts. Some needs have a test model to try this kind of device and probably several men of different dimensions. The one I ordered is the large. The dimensions are wrong wrong, the top first ring is 2&#34; then 1 3/4&#34;, should be 2 1/4 then 2&#34;  , the front rings stacked together are the same size 1 1/4&#34;, should be a minimum of 1 3/4&#34; and the two rings pointing east and west are 1 1/2&#34;, they should be at least 1 3/4&#34;. This is a bear to get on and a tiger to get of. It will cause swelling from the restriction. !!!!!!Amazon would make the customers happier to require all these kinds of products that are going to be contact with skin to be made of stainless steel. Some foreign manufacturing mix nickle and other unknown metals, which cause allergies, by the way if it plated-it ain't stainless. Of all the products I have bought in the past 12 months only one was really stainless and sterling silver was plastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2013-09-19

The powder mixes well in the battery powered mixer, though it has something of that pancake batter consistency.<br /><br />The flavor was my main concern, and it is a bit odd. It does not taste much like a banana shake or a banana drink. The first impression that I get is that I am drinking cookie-cream or cake flavor. After about 3-4 gulps I can isolate the weak flavor of banana. I think these tubs were remixed into banana flavor, perhaps because they had some other flavor that was not selling very well. It does not taste like something that is 100% banana flavor.<br /><br />I honestly have not had much of this after the first few times. I usually drink the protein shake for breakfast, and the odd combination of flavors has on some occasions given me a bit of nausea on an empty stomach in the morning. So I just drink this occasionally.	2013-06-09

Considering that Unisom can be purchased over the counter without a prescription, I considered it to be extremely safe, however after taking only one capsule, the results were difficult to believe. After about an hour, I started to have problems with heart palpatations and became concerned that I might need to check with a doctor or health professional for an explanation of why this was occurring. Anyhow, I weather the storm, and finally managed to go to sleep, however I was awakened during the night after what I can truthfully say that I experienced the most horrible dream that I have ever been subjected to. There were demons involved, suicidal thoughts, and murder involving some of my best friends. Other ratings show that this product has been effective for some, but I would strongly advise that it should be taken very cautiously, and please do not believe that just because this is a non-prescription item that no harmful effects can occur. Sorry, but It was an absolutely dreadful experience for me, and therefore my recommendation would be that a warning should be printed on the product to advise that this sort of adverse reaction could occur. Prescription medications have been much more effective for me.	2013-06-05

Having read the whole, I see no reason the same functions couldn't be delivered in a simpler intuitive design.  At the end of one of the days when I thought I was recording my activity, I found that it hadn't recorded anything. I'm sorry to say that I eventually gave up and put this aside.  I wanted something to track my activity, steps, calories burned, etc.  I'm going back to a straight-forward pedometer that does nothing but count steps.<br /><br />Another negative is that device bounces out of the little plastic holder/clothing clip easily when you're active.<br /><br />Excessive packaging frustrates me, and this certainly has it.  Uploading a photo of the newly opened package.  I'm sure others will disagree, but including a screwdriver that most people won't need strikes me as over-the-top wasteful.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I can't think of anything to say that's positive about this product. It is cute, I guess.	2013-04-25

I was looking for a soft bonnet to replace diffusing for my 2c/3a hair. No matter what method I try, I always, always end up with frizz and fuzzy ends diffusing. I bought this one and the dryer attachment so I could test them both. This didn't last five minutes on my head before I gave in.<br />First of all, the bonnet is huge and heavy. If you're doing a roller set and had some big curlers to hold it up, this might not be an issue, but it didn't work for my purposes- just bonnet drying my normal hair. The bonnet was so awkward that it just didn't stay up.<br />Second, the hose is pretty short. I couldn't even put the dryer on the toilet and stand up with it. I basically had to set it up on my lap.<br />Third, it just didn't feel warm enough to me. I tweaked the settings a little and nada. Maybe this is due to the empty space in the bonnet, again. I'm just guessing this isn't meant for what I needed.<br />Fourth, even if this had dried my hair well, I'm not sure I would have kept it. I travel a lot and having something portable is important. It doesn't matter if I get great hair on a day at home if I can't replicate it on vacation or a weekend away. It's pretty big.<br />I ended up loving the cheapo soft bonnet attachment by the same brand. Common negative reviews said that it didn't stay on their head and didn't fit their dryer. I didn't experience either of those issues and was left with the absolute best curls I've ever had.<br />If you're using this for rollers, I'd say maybe give it a try. For conditioning or if you're looking to replace a diffuser, this is probably not for you.	2013-03-13

You can see the original review under this. The problem was not with the scale, but with the linoleum flooring in my house, as the VP William Geronimo told me. He was very helpful and sent out a tile and new scale just in case! This fixed the problem right away and I always get pin point measurements now and he even told me to keep the extra scale and give it to someone who needed it.<br /><br />This company has the best support I have ever run into and I buy a lot of things. They really care about their product and about their client! I would recommend this scale to anyone trying to get in shape and I would be happy to see more products from EatSmart so I could buy them!<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />As my title says don't trust the 400lb weight limit. I just got this scale for myself as a gift after hitting my goal weight of 380 from 410! I double checked all the steps to calibrate it and set it up but every time I stand on it the weight goes down. I will start at around the right weight, then it will fall 5 pounds, then another and do this every time I stand on it. Also it won't give me any of the extra information.<br /><br />So bigger people be warned if you are trying to get in shape and in the higher 30's this is not the scale for you :(.<br /><br />On a side note it works great on my roommate who is 212 pounds, and it is very sleek looking.	2012-11-08

I have a 2 year old, front-loading, HE washer and wash at least a few loads once or twice a week.  I've used the packs in all temperatures of water and in various sizes of loads, some requiring two packs, as recommended.  In one cold wash, I had one of my husband's polo shirts come out with a white residue that looked somewhat like sweat stains, but I don't believe it was, especially after going through the wash cycle and dryer.  I've never had that happen until using these packs.  Beyond that, I think they are pretty effective for a normal wash.  I don't, however, feel that they clean as well as my normal liquid detergent with \\\\\"stain lifter\\\\\", as some clothes had small (oily?) stains remaining after washing.<br /><br />They are certainly convenient and I feel would be especially handy for those using a laundromat or shared laundry facilities.  I did not notice any significant scent remaining on the clothes, though I do always use a liquid fabric softener as well.  My clothes smelled like they normally do.<br /><br />If you are concerned about the environment and want a detergent that is natural and mildly scented, I recommend you give this a try.<br /><br />I will update if I have any additional info to add as I continue to use Seventh Generation Natural Laundry Detergent Packs."	2012-09-06

After using it for a winter, I think there are better options out there.<br /><br />Here are the drawbacks that I've encountered:<br />1) The water housing is tricky to remove and fill.  You fill it from the bottom of the \\\\\"duck head\\\\\" which I thought was a little unintuitive.  Shouldn't it fill from the top?<br />2) It's big.  There are smaller humidifiers out there.  As the number of kid stuff accumulates in the room, the novelty of the appearance wears off.<br />3) Kind of scary looking in the dark.  There's a green light above the switch.  In the dark, it lights up the head and can look a little creepy.  We've put a piece of tape over the light.<br />4) Not the quietest.  We had a Vicks humidifier which was extremely quiet.  This one produces a rumbling noise.  It didn't really bother our son, but if you're noise sensitive, look for quieter units.<br /><br />If I were to purchase another humidifier, I would probably recommend this one:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Vicks-Warm-Mist-Humidifier-Shut-Off/dp/B001FWXKTA/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1326326925&sr=1-2"	2012-01-12

"First of all let me state that I was looking for a long-range IR flashlight when I came across this one, and was very excited to see how the manufacturer claimed that it could shine out to 300 yards. I was skeptical, with the light having just a cluster of IR LEDs with no focus mirror or lens, I thought no-way, and I was right. This light disperses a nice very wide beam that with my Gen1 night vision, can be used to see out to about 25 yards. With the much higher sensitivity of Gen2 & Gen3, I'm sure you will be able to see much further to maybe 100 yards. The bright cherry red glow of the LEDs (like with any security camera's LEDs) is visible to the naked eye for about 25 yards. The light states \\\\\"for intermittent use only\\\\\" so that it does not heat up excessively, and total on-time using 2x Li-Ion Tenergy 900mAh rechargable batteries is 1 hour. The unit is very rugged in construction. The customer service from the Pentagon company is amazing. I ended up mounting the flashlight to my nightvision headset which does a good job at lighting up everything in front of me for 25 yards or so. I then mounted it on a rifle for shooting troublesome night critters and it works very well for that. Good for night critters/poor for tactical. You must pay attention placing the batteries in since its batteries go in the opposite direction of most flashlights."	2011-10-29

I injured my finger (mallet finger injury) and was looking at 6 weeks in a splint.

I can wear it 24/7, it's waterproof, supports my finger, I can type with it on, shower, basically anything... love it.<br />Two comments, though. One, the splint supports so well that if you try to be too active while wearing the splint you can put pressure on the skin/bone surrounding the injury site. I fished all day wearing the splint and the injury felt fine, but the surrounding area was sore. Second, I recommend buying two sizes to start- the correct size for where you will be using it (see the instruction on how to size) and the next size up to allow for any temporary swelling in the finger. I started with a size 5 splint and am glad I just received the 6!	2010-08-22

Ultra Source of Life vitamins were recommended to me by a friend who has been taking them for a few years and says they help her have energy and feel good.  She said she noticed a difference when she ran out and had to go without them.  I have been taking for several months and they seem to be helping me feel more energetic.  I recently noticed my fingernails are stronger.  It seems like a good product because there are a lot of other things included besides vitamins like bee pollen, whole food extracts, lutein, algaes, etc.  Also, even if I take them without much food, they don't upset my stomach like other supplements have.  I guess my only caution would be the fact that I haven't done a whole lot of research into potential side effects of ALL the other ingredients.  (There are so many!)  But if you're looking for a good multi-vit, this is a good one to try out!   (p.s. Buying on Amazon.com got me the same product for MUCH cheaper than the local health-food store.)	2010-07-20

First off, Taylor shave creams are excellent.  They are comparable in quality to all the other high end English shave creams, and come in a slightly smaller tub for way less money.  That's preferable if you're like me and like to stock a wide variety so you can smell what you want to smell whenever you shave.    So check on Taylor being as good as the others.  Don't let any reviewer sway you that DR Harris or others are sooo much better.  I've found different brands make better and worse in different scents.  DR Harris has the best lavender, Taylor has the best Sandalwood, Trumper owns Violet.    This St James stuff is interesting.  At first I really didn't care for the scent, and that was after taking in a good whiff at a local shave shop.  I came home and ordered on Amazon to save about $10, and when it got to me for whatever reason I just wasn't as fond as I'd been.    That being said, scent is a very personal kind of determination.  I like it enough to use it, but it's not my every day smell.    What is EXCEPTIONAL about this product is the quality of its lather.  It is far and away the best lathering cream I have ever encountered.  It makes me wonder if the smell is just a byproduct of their having crammed every lathering agent into the same cream.    It is extraordinarily comfortable.  If I have a special occasion and I need to be as clean shaven as possible then this is what I use.  You basically can't cut yourself with this stuff on.    So if you want a super lathery cream and you haven't been happy with others then go for this.  It's great with that.    I only gave it four stars because of the less than universally acceptable scent, but I'm tending towards 4.5.	2010-05-04

I wouldn't wish that kind of pain on my worst enemy. At one point I was getting them about every four to six weeks. I was fed up with making doctor's appointments and paying a copay when I knew exactly what was wrong and what I needed, and I was tired of doctors telling me the same thing every time - urinate before/after sex, wipe front to back, drink lots of water, take cranberry. After my mom suggested I look for a holistic remedy, I found D-Mannose. This stuff has changed my life. I haven't had a UTI since I started taking a daily dose three months ago. If I start to feel a twinge of UTI pain, I just up the dosage, drink lots of water and feel better within hours. If you're having frequent UTIs, D-Mannose is the cure.     In a pinch, you can find the Now Foods brand at Whole Foods for around $33.	2009-09-16

The chemo treatments I am on have repressed my immune system so anything working well for me now should work better for others.  I showed a remarkable improvement within 24 hours of using this product.  I have been using it less than a week but I am very impressed by it.	2007-08-14

I purchased this one from Amazon after loaning my first Medisana to an ailing friend and not getting it back.  It's the most compact humidifier on the market, which results in some trade-off in water capacity and running time (count on a good six hours)--but it's as easy to accommodate on your nightstand and to refill as a glass of water. Turn the blue light off and you'll be unaware of its presence, except for the noticeable improvement in breathing.<br /><br />As a couple of previous reviewers have noted, the nozzle appears to have a predilection for getting jammed, or smog-bound, a problem I never noticed with the previous, apparently identical model.  I'm not convinced it's due to the use of eucalyptus oil, but it's definitely not a terminal condition.  I removed, washed and dried the nozzle to no avail.  Then I did the same with the cannister, filling it to the top and even shaking it before re-setting it on its base.  Voila!  Immediately the vapors stopped congregating in the nozzle area and burst forth as buoyant zephyrs on a therapeutic mission.  Haven't noticed any problems since this initial obstruction.  If the nozzle doesn't deliver its little clouds of glory the instant you push the \\\\\"on\\\\\" button, turn it off, try the little refill-castanet maneuver with the cannister, and you should be in business.<br /><br />Not recommended for the living room or office, but as an agreeable, comforting night-time companion, it rivals my cat."	2006-02-11

Then I can watch shows on a 7&#34; tablet because I'm too stupid to watch the same show on a 46&#34; TV?  According to TW's techie, even with RR I can't watch anything outside my home because that would require a wifi connection and so sorry, if it's not RR it's a case of too bad, so sad!<br />If someone knows of a way I can remove this useless app from my Kindle Fire I would very grateful.	2014-10-19

I like my job and want to keep it, but this kid was an absolute pain. So I brainstormed some ways to keep him entertained. We have iPads so I figured a game would be best. I also thought about getting on the bosses good side, so I decided to kill two birds with one stone and get an educational game.<br /><br />I grabbed Pre-School All In One Learning: Bubble School Adventures. Great move on my part. This game by 22 Learn is awesome. The toddler absolutely loves it. Instead of pestering me, he sits quietly at a desk and plays Bubble School Adventure. He cannot get enough of this game.<br /><br />And for my boss, he is thrilled too. The kid is happy and he is learning. My boss said he just got a report from his sons’ pre-school saying he is ahead of the class. The Pre-School All In One Learning: Bubble School Adventures is a win-win for anyone with a toddler or even around a toddler. Highly recommended.	2014-01-17

I'm not big on a lot of games, but once you get started in this one there is just no turning back. Your mind automatically goes into &quot;Must. get. to. next. levellll...&quot; mode. I'll be disappointed when the game is over. But hey, there are plentyyy of levels. The only thing I hate about this game is having to wait 30 minutes or so (to slowly gain back lives) before you can play again after you use all of your lives. I guess it's a good thing though, otherwise I would be stuck in it all day.	2014-01-13

But sometimes me and my friend are trying to get in the same chatroom and we have to keep switching back and forth until we get the same cafe, beach, etc, etc. You get the point. Anyway, so we spend hours until we are in the same chatroom (exaggeration) and then the screen goes gray every 15 minutes and brings me back to my homescreen. I try to sign in and the first few times it says problems w/ connection. To sum it up:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Not laggy<br />-Fun<br />-Serves purpose<br />-When signed in, good connection<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Trouble signing in<br />-Brings to homescreen suddenly<br /><br />Overall, this is a good app. I'd give it 3 1/2 if I could.	2014-01-06

It has all the elements that make a match-three game fun plus a few other elements to make it unique. Each level gets a little more difficult. The player has to make additional matches nearby to free up the locked tiles. Each round earns bricks which then build up houses for fairies (or maybe the comical creatures are elves.) The game gives you options for difficulty so that a player who prefers an simpler game can choose the easy level while a more experience player can select a more difficult level. The graphics are pleasant. As usual Big Fish delivers an excellent game.	2013-10-25

All of them were 5-star glowing reviews.<br /><br />For good reason.  By the time I had posted, there was one more, and my review will continue that trend.  It may not seem like it, but to get 14 out of 14 reviewers giving 5-stars on an app is very rare.  There are dozens, if not hundreds, of these types of games on Amazon and elsewhere; I personally have at least 20, and probably double that.  NONE of them have ever come CLOSE to the offering of Hidden Objects Quest 6!<br /><br />Great stereo atmospheric music, and great graphics on 10\\\\\" tablet; you can tell the care the developer took to create each scene.  You won't be irritated or disappointed by the music or sound effects, and if you are then simply reduce the volume in the settings.  There is also a Zoom button in the upper right corner.<br /><br />The game has two modes: Kid's Mode and Adventure Mode.  The Kid's Mode is made for kids, and I have no doubt that my 5-year-old daughter will be able to play, and enjoy, this game.<br />In Kid's Mode, the objective is to find the objects as quickly as possible.  The object to find is located on a platform/table at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />Adventure mode is quite challenging; the developer took great effort to create each of the 24 scenes.  Each of the scenes has three Quests, and a bonus quest to unlock through perfect scores.  Each of the Quests has three different quest types to choose from, but there are more than a dozen different quest types for the game to offer!  Similar to other games of this type, you unlock each scene by competing the scene before it.  The difficulty gets harder as you complete more scenes.<br /><br />All of the quests are timed, and while some of the modes have no penalties, others have great penalties for using the hints system.  Word of advice: try not to use the Hint system.<br /><br />Many of the different types of Quests:<br /> + Classic Object Quest<br /> + Classic Conveyor<br /> + Silhouette Search<br /> + Silhouette Conveyor<br /> + Words - Find named object (English only, just like the rest of the Quests involving words)<br /> + Object Words Conveyor<br /> + Scramble<br /> + Search in the Fog<br /> + Hangman<br /> + Hidden Bomb Time Search<br /> + Searchlight<br /> + Find the Differences<br /> + Mirror-Mirror Search<br /><br />To extend the replayability of this game, the developer added in a couple dozen different achievements.  Many of them will require playing the game multiple times.<br /><br />The only caveat play-wise is that the Back button functions as an immediate exit - could be helpful or annoying depending on your point of view.<br /><br />Now for the bad news:<br />I *ALMOST* deducted one star for having:<br /> - Flurry Analytics  -  [note: disabled in app according to developer]<br /> - Facebook Developer Tools - [note: disabled in app according to developer]<br /><br />In the end, the amazing work that went into this app made up for the flaws.<br /><br />I've been playing for two hours, and I'm a little more than half way through the adventure mode.  Add in the Kid's Mode and the two dozen achievements, this becomes one game that will deeply engross you.  (I didn't realize I'd been playing for two hours!)<br /><br />Summary: Very few games are this worthy of it's $2 price tag!  Two thumbs up.

When we're talking about this game, anything is better! I downloaded it for my daughter. I failed to see any warning sign that this would be a depressive game that requires you to torture the animal to get responses. I found it cruel and hateful. I wasn't amused in any way with the reaction from the cat nor the misleading intentions of the game. I thought we'd be petting the kitty and he'd beg for more. Apparently you beat the cat to get reactions. It sucks and has no value as a game. Worthless and vile. Apparently the developer has issues and we all know what starts with animal abuse usually ends in a story line fit for CSI.	2013-05-14

This game is fun and easy, and I don't have to worry about my daughter not being able to do something on it.  The only thing I think could be done better is that above the first few pets, it asks you to purchase &#34;Bling&#34; which is very expensive and I wish would have the capability of being disabled since my daughter doesn't understand what it is.  Since I have one touch payment she could easily purchase something without me realizing it.  Otherwise, great game!	2013-03-18

I gave this 4 and not 5 because I have yet to test it out on my five year old to see if she likes it. I am growing tired of complainers, I do not download every free app, most do not interest me.

This weekend would have been a coaster if I didn't have my k fire for my 8 year old to play while I was at the eye doctor with he 11 year old. People are so quick to judge people and say spend time with your kids instead of using electronics to babysit them, well news flash, sometimes parents attention needs to be else where and children do not understand that when they are bored and since most of you do not have children..... they are bored within about 2.5 minutes, so see how much you can get done in that 2.5 minutes without something to occupy them.

Her work is definitely avant garde but in no way is it ALIENATING. I consider her voice as a composer to be ingratiating, generous, welcoming. Her Violin Concerto, previously recorded, is a beautiful, emphatic, definitive work. It demonstrates her deep rapport with the Concerto Principle. I am not speaking as a musicologist but as a music lover. The essence of the Concerto is the interplay of a soloist and a mass of other musicians. How they interact, share the stage and the musical material; how each asserts the identity of its component of the whole; how each acknowledges the other - these are aspects of the Concerto which set it apart from symphonic works. There is an inherent dramatic structure in the Concerto, which can range from adversarial to cooperative. For someone who finds these dimensions of the Concerto transcend the merely virtuoso display, I can fully recommend this disc. I have an older cd of three Concertos - cello, violin, piano - of Gyorgy Ligeti, conducted by Pierre Boulez. I cite this disc because Ligeti was Unsuk Chin's mentor, and it is fascinating to play these two cds in tandem. The young and the old, the East and the West, the contemporary and the modern are in perfect sync. It renews one's faith in the Orphic Power of Music.	2015-04-05

I certainly concur with the very fine reviews written by John Puccio, and B  Guerrero.  If you study Mahler releases at all, you'll know their names.  But I especially agree with the point made by Mr. Kirchhoff that Stenz has the sense of humor to really make this symphony fly.  M2 was my favorite Mahler symphony for years, but 7 seems to be the one I'm enjoying most these days.    Want a wonderful M7, this one is quite fine.  And to my taste it is the absolute leader available on SACD.  The sound is gorgeous, by the way.	2014-04-11

I am a jazz fan and a Brad Mehldau fan. However, this album is a huge disappointment to me. It is electric, but I would not consider this jazz fusion. It has a very modern, urban feel to it. It makes use of significant electronic distortion, loops, voice overs, etc. that you would not commonly associate with jazz. There are a number of songs with voice and or electronically altered vocals, mostly spoken. Before you buy this album, listen to the sample of the first song, the title song, &#34;Taming the Dragon&#34;, so that you know what you are getting. It is essentially a story (not an incredibly interesting story) being told over a background of electronic sounds, interspersed with synthesizer breaks that are hard to listen to. Maybe this album will be reviewed as a tremendous breakthrough in music by some. Maybe I will end up sounding like those that cursed Dylan and Miles for going electric. Maybe there is a market for this. Maybe it is well performed for whatever it is (in fact, given Brad's talent, I assume it is). But I absolutely assure you that there will not be much of an overlap between Meldau's long time acoustic jazz fans and the audience that like this album. Just make sure you listen to some of this first before you buy it expecting you know what you are getting. As for me, I have already bought it. I don't know how to return a download or I would try. I have listened to it twice. I cannot imagine listening to it again.	2014-02-26

US	51184997	R25DR9RFSREJXX	B00DD0AFL8	823630034	Collectors Edition: Tchaikovsky: The Symphonies [6 CD]	Music	3	4	10	N	N	Consistently bland Tchaikovsky from a conductor who doesn't like the music much, apparently	This set represents the return of Haitink's out-of-print Tchaikovsky cycle from the Seventies. He had recorded Sym. 6 and 6 on their own previously but redid them for the complete cycle. Unlike Karajan, who made one complete Tchaikovsky cycle and any number of separate recordings of the last three symphonies, Haitink has never returned to any of the symphonies on disc in four decades. Usually such neglect would indicate a lack of sympathy with the scores, and I was aware that his Tchaikovsky, like his Beethoven, is rarely recommended in listings of the best accounts.  So I was curious to see in practice how this overlooked cycle fares.<br /><br />Courtesy of a previous review, &#34;G.C.,&#34; here are the relevant recording dates:<br />a. &#34;Capriccio Italien&#34; - 1961<br />b. &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; - 1964<br />c. &#34;1812&#34; Overture, &#34;Marche slave&#34;, &#34;Francesca da Rimini&#34; - 1972<br />d. Symphony No. 5 - 1974<br />e. Symphony No. 2, &#34;The Storm&#34; Overture - 1977<br />f. Symphony No. 6 - 1976<br />g. Symphony No. 4 - 1978<br />h. Symphonies Nos. 1 & 3, &#34;Manfred&#34; Symphony - 1979<br /><br />The Penguin Guide seems to make the best of things when it says that &#34;Haitink's readings are satisfyingly consistent and they have genuine symphonic strength.&#34; As you'd expect, the Royal Concertgebouw plays beautifully, and at this point in their partnership, they responded with considerable verve to Haitink. (A recent comparable budget cycle from Ormandy doesn't always sound as committed or generally as well recorded.) Philips had a mixed reputation for its sonics from this period, but they sound fine to me - clear, detailed, with a natural perspective that's fairly close. Of course over such a long span of years - two items date from the Sixties, well before the symphonies - there will be individual differences.<br /><br />When the Penguin Guide praises Haitink's consistency, that can be read as saying that while none of these readings sinks below a good standard, none rises to the highest standard, as set by great Tchaikovskians on the order of Bernstein, Karajan, Mravinsky, and Gergiev.  I know that there's a contingent of listeners who characterize Haitink as Mr. Monotony. It's true that his best showing is in concert, and my regard for him, which was fairly neutral at one time, rose once I heard him live. Because his approach to these scores is direct and without much personality, I won't give detailed comments, only a few remarks about what stood out.<br /><br />Sym. 1 &#34;Winter Dreams&#34; is played in a moderate fashion from beginning to end. It has the negative virtue of not being too slow or &#34;tranquillo&#34; in the long first movement- like Ormandy, Haitink more or less ignores Tchaikovsky's direction here. The Allegro portion of the finale is festive and invigorating; the middle movements leave little impression.<br /><br />Sym. 2 &#34;Little Russian&#34; is also sensibly conducted, which in the first movement means moving the music along so that it doesn't seem overly repetitious and drawn out.  Unfortunately, the second movement drags and is underplayed.  By contrast, the Scherzo is done more vigorously than usual; it comes off well if not brilliantly. Haitink captures the ceremonial grandness at the beginning of the finale very well, but like Ormandy he tends to let the line lose tension in the faster music with its delicate woodwind writing. This movement needs to be unified with a strong through line, and Haitink just misses.<br /><br />Sym. 3 &#34;Polish&#34; is more discursive and even garrulous than its two predecessors, coming off in long stretches as ballet music that proceeds gently and without hurry. For me, the best readings, such as Svetlanov's live one on BBC Legends, find more dramatic contrast and pacing than usual.  Haitink isn't interested in such an approach, and as a result the first three movements are agreeable but unmemorable.  Nor are they so gorgeouslyplayed that your ear is ravished. The Scherzo could use more brilliant, pinpoint woodwind playing. In reaching for utmost delicacy, Haitink risks making the music feel underplayed.  the finale, as in the first two symphonies, is ceremonial and festive. Haitink delivers a good account but a rather low-key one. This reading falls short of what he achieved in Sym. 1 and 2, largely because the &#34;Polish&#34; is a harder score to carry off.<br /><br />Sym. 4 brings us into the crammed field of the last three symphonies, where experienced listeners will know of four or five great recordings.  I feared that Haitink, if he felt unsympathetic with Tchaikovsky's unembarrassed passion,  would draw back too much to convey the depth of these scores.  In the event, Sym. 4 is given a sensible reading of the first movement, a nicely poised second movement (just a bit impatient in the pacing), a lovely display of unanimity in the pizzicato Scherzo, and a finale that rises above the preceding movements by displaying more fire than Ormandy summons - the composer marks it &#34;con fuoco&#34; - but we aren't in the ultra-exciting world of Gergiev or Szell.<br /><br />Sym. 5 was selected by Decca to be in their Ultimate Tchaikovsky box set, so I was interested to hear if Haitink does something special with a work that appeals instantly but rarely yields a sense of depth, as much as Tchaikovsky wanted it to. The problem is that the motto on which the first and last movements rests isn't profound enough to do the heavy emotional work he intended. It takes the extra intensity of Mravinsky or Bernstein to elevate the score.  As it turns out, Haitink doesn't depart from his sensible ways, as in the Fourth. The score proceeds without memorable events, even though the playing is lovely.  The overall lack of intensity dashed my hopes that this performance might be a high point in the cycle.<br /><br />Sym. 6 &#34;Pathetique&#34; is not only Tchaikovsky's symphonic masterpiece but the symphony that has evoked the greatest recordings from conductors as diverse as Furtwangler, Reiner, Mravinsky, Tennstedt, and Gergiev.  Up to this point in his cycle, Haitink has resembled Ormandy, who is at his best in the early symphonies but who falls off in the last three, where inspiration counts the most.  If the passions of the first movement don't create passion in the conducting, he simply doesn't want to engage with the music. That's true of Ormandy and almost as true of Haitink. He continues to be sensible where ardor is called for.  The off-kilter 5/4 waltz fails to lift off, the Scherzo is tame when it should be scintillating, the tragic finale is mournful instead. In a word, the score has more potential for strong expression than Haitink is willing t look for.<br /><br />Even dedicated Tchaikovsky conductors have bypassed the sprawling, inconsistent &#34;Manfred&#34; Symphony, including Mravinsky and Gergiev (so far) even though it is standard fare in Russia.  On another thread a commenter said that Haitink's account was his favorite, and the reason may be that the rhetoric of the piece is so overblown in the first and last movements that Haitink's moderation could be a blessing.  He doesn't dig into the wrenching descending bass line at the outset, a marker for how wild an interpretation is going to be.  I think it's fair to say that &#34;Manfred&#34; isn't a masterpiece waiting for its depths to be explored; it's a problematic work that needs inspired tactics to rescue the worst sections wile making the best ones sound inspired.  Toscanini's famed accounts - there are two in circulation - work by applying incredible dramatic tension, and also by judiciously cutting a weak section from the finale; other conductors have tampered with the score by rewriting the bombastic ending (e.g., Svetlanov).  Unfortunately, Haitink's reading turns out to be a devil's bargain, because while he successfully downplays the bombast and vulgarity, he underplays the two beautifulinner movements.<br /><br />Since I can't report any remarkable successes among the symphonies, it seemed a bit pointless to bother with the fillers. This is a cycle that doesn't rise above the Ormandy overall, and where Ormandy has some fine readings and lush orchestral playing, Haitink delivers almost no high spots.to this point in his cycle, Haitink has resembled Ormandy, who is at his best in the early symphonies but who falls off in the last three, where inspiration counts the most.

"Review by William Ruhlmann<br /><br />At a time when Barbra Streisand's career was in decline, what turned out to be only her first greatest-hits album seemed to serve as both a summing up and a kiss-off of her 1960s recordings. Streisand was not primarily a singles artist; between 1964 and 1969, she enjoyed nine chart singles, of which only one, \\\\\"People,\\\\\" made the Top Ten, with only one other, \\\\\"Second Hand Rose,\\\\\" reaching the Top 40. But in that time, she scored seven gold-selling, Top Ten albums. This hits collection contained seven of her chart singles, plus her non-charting early single \\\\\"My Coloring Book,\\\\\" \\\\\"Happy Days Are Here Again,\\\\\" which was one of the highlights of her debut album (heard here in the live version from A Happening in Central Park), and \\\\\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\\\\" from the Funny Girl soundtrack. For casual fans, that made for a good sampling of Streisand's most prominent '60s work, and if at the time it seemed likely that this was all the hits there would be, instead the '60s proved to be only the first chapter in Streisand's career."	2013-10-09

There's some moderately fun stuff here (\\\\\"Seawall,\\\\\" \\\\\"Hearts and Minds,\\\\\" . . . \\\\\"Shine On\\\\\" is a nice coda, I suppose), but let's be honest:<br /><br />1.  It's not \\\\\"Straightaways,\\\\\" let alone \\\\\"Trace.\\\\\"<br />2.  If you find yourself humming songs from those albums, or singing them in the shower, well, you probably won't be doing the same with these songs.  I'm not, and I'm pretty sure a few dozen more listens isn't going to alter that reality.<br />3.  If you're like me, your mind will start to wander in the middle of this set, for the songs have a sameness that makes them easy to ignore.<br />4.  For a tribute to the Bakersfield sound, you'd think even dour young Jay Farrar would realize that Buck, Dwight, etc., had a lot more fun with this kind of material.<br /><br />And I think that's my biggest problem; for all the musical virtuosity on display, there's little sense of mischief, or joy.  That may be too much to ask of this band at this point, hence the title of this review, but I find that the Avett Brothers are scratching the itch this band used to, so I can only conclude that, as saccharine as the Avett's occasionally can be, I'm a sucker for the notion that it's good for a band to convey that they enjoy what they're doing.  Your mileage may vary.

"This is the second VU release from Keyhole Records, but it's actually a better performance and better-sounding tape than their [[ASIN:B009LMBVTW La Cave 1968]]release. This actually wasn't the 1st night they played At The End Of Cole Ave, it's just the first night that was recorded. Some of the next night's performance (which was also recorded) ended up on [[ASIN:B000001FOD Velvet Underground Live 1969 volume 1]] and [[ASIN:B000001FOE Live 2]]. The sound on those recordings are mastered slightly better than you find them here, however, they got to cherry pick: the vocals sometimes get a little distant on some of these songs. Sound quality is comparable to [[ASIN:B000WS8AUC The Velvet Underground Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes]]. Mandatory for all Velvet Underground faithful, but not the place for a beginning VU fan to start. I am quite excited to see that \\\\\" [[ASIN:B00C5AKGUM At the End of Cole Ave - Second Night]] is coming out in May 2013."	2013-04-04

Like another reviewer, I was a bit reluctant because I could not listen to any samples first, but the reviews convinced me to take a chance on this one. I received the cd about a month ago and have listened to it almost daily since. There are 2 songs that I'm not particularly fond of, but all of the others are wonderful. My favorite song changes from day to day, and the beats and melodies unique to this type of music get me motivated and dancing around in the morning while getting ready for work. It's a bit frustrating not knowing what the singers are saying, but the tunes are so catchy that it doesn't stop me from singing along with my own made-up lyrics :-). I highly recommend this collection to anyone who wants to dip their toes into this music genre!	2013-03-30

On Beggars Banquet the Stones put the psychedelia and the 60's rock and roll thing into the passenger seat and delivered a stunning album with deep blues roots.  This is one of my favourite Stones albums of all time and I think it is really just one of those albums that I will never tire listening to.<br /><br />  Really does not need a lot words here as so much has been said already and documented on this album.<br /><br />  What I can say though is that the sound on the ABKCO Hybrid SACD is very good.  This would be right up there with all the other ABKCO SACD's with excellent clarity , sound dynamics and mastering (Bob Ludwig) .<br /><br />It is the subtle things about this SACD that I notice ....things like clear multi-layered sound and instrument definition.

Can't help but wonder what happened to them but like so many at the time who couldn't separate the rap from the life, or for whom there really was no separation they hit it and quit it. One album wonders from '93 banging the best of both coast. They rap about sweet home Detroit and the hood in a tune or two(DBG'z is for Dank, Brew & Gunz-not Detroit or any such thing)kicking the hard core with a message from the studios of LA. The production is top notch though with funky beats that aren't just straight rips from top hits of the 70's and 80's. Definitely worth adding to the collection if you're a rap aficionado.	2012-10-30

As a pianist I have accompanied the \\\\\"Songs of Travel\\\\\" numerous times for singers, both professional and amateur, and have formed ideas about what really makes these songs work. As much as I find Terfel's voice to be thrilling in timbre and spot on in tuning, he simply makes too much of a good thing in many of these. What he does well is just amazing, such as the sotto voce in \\\\\"The Vagabond\\\\\" expanding to a fortissimo, but that is idiosyncratic and certainly not to everyone's taste. Luxon's approach is better, but I'm not wild about his voice and the recording is too reverberant. Williams and Burnside hit it right on the head with a performance that really gleams with beautiful tone colors, gorgeous phrasing and perfect tempi, but still keep things relatively simple -- an ideal combination. My only lover's quarrel with this recordingIng is that I find that Mr. Williams is placed too much to the fore in what should be  more even-handed duet. There is no lack of detail in the excellent piano playing, but I find it in general to be a little too recessed.

I purchased this CD as a present to someone who didn't have any of his own. I've made collections myself for the car or for friends, and while I might have chosen a couple of different songs, most of them aren't the blues (e.g., \\\\\"Slave Driver\\\\\"), which is what Scorsese was trying to cover, so I think his taste is simply impeccable.

If you have even a passing interest in songs about driving or trucks or the open road then this is a must.

There is a trucking Christmas album and an album devoted to policeman included in the set.<br /><br />Red sings in sort of a straightforward monotone but that is not to say he is not a good singer.

Sound and performance are both excellent.<br /><br />The Vienna State Opera Orchestra is the parent orchestra for the Vienna Philharmonic.  Accordingly, the musicianship is of the highest caliber.<br /><br />Hermann Scherchen was an inventive conductor whose performance tempi for music of this type were centered in the late-classical/early-romantic period of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.  This \\\\\"Sonata\\\\\" approach means fast is really fast and slow is highly contrasted.  In this instance, however, many tempi are slightly slower than his usual, and the music is allowed to breathe like a fine wine.  In addition, Scherchen always pays careful attention to detail.  As a result, his performances tend to provide everything the composer put on paper.<br /><br />Julian Olevski (also spelled Olevsky) was a great violinist who at the time of his death was Professor of Violin and artist in residence at the University of Massachusetts at Amhurst.  Many critics considered him to be in the top rank.  His performances tend to be both songful and powerful, with superior intonation.<br /><br />The result is that these are wonderfully atmospheric performances of the 4 Seasons in outstanding sound for 1958 Stereo.  Of all the versions I have known, these performances remain my favorites and the ones I return to when I want to hear Vivaldi.<br /><br />The Gloria is also well done, but for me the piece is less engaging than the 4 Seasons.<br /><br />This is a recording I have owned in one medium or another for 54 years.

Many artists have tried to replicate Bush's brand of dreaminess, but always seem to be lacking a certain something.  Although not everyone's taste, one must admit that Kate Bush is a rare and unique talent.  That talent is ever apparent and present on her latest effort, 50 Words for Snow, a collection of seven songs that feel like the dead of winter.  Each one like a snowflake to create a blanket that will not melt until spring.  It seems that Bush has grown as an artist, as each song takes us through a different story she has lived.  While `Lake Tahoe' and `Misty' may put us down to slumber for the winter, `Wild Man' wakes us for a waking dream.  The title track gives us enough momentum to make a nice cup of hot cocoa, before snuggling back in for `Among Angels.'  With subtle guest spots from Elton John and Stephen Fry, it makes the winter not seem as lonely.  Bush's voice has become a bit more weathered and has developed a certain raspy quality that may remind one of Marianne Faithfull or PJ Harvey at times, but with a certain avant garde that also draws upon Laurie Anderson.  On 50 Words for Snow, she has created an album that would not make sense played outside the wintertime, but is distinctly NOT a holiday album- a feat that has so far gone unmatched.  While the winter cold may drag on, Bush has given us a musical companion that will make the winter chill more bearable.	2011-12-13

Although never in the same class as contemporaries such as Connie Francis, Brenda Lee or Gale Storm in terms of commercial success, she did register four hits on the Billboard Pop Top/Hot charts from 1956 to 1959, added two more to the Bubble Under lists in 1960 and 1962 and, in a span covering 1953 to 1967, had some 29 singles released along with an album.<br /><br />This 1997 Marginal Records of Belgium release, in giving you 32 tracks from among that catalogue of her music in their trademark &#34;Cedarized&#34; AAD sound reproduction (not bad), including failed singles and their B-sides, they omit the flipside of her first and biggest hit, plus both sides of her third hit.<br /><br />Born Angelina Helen Catherine Cordovano in the Bronx section of New York City on June 28, 1925, she had her first experience with Show Business on the Horn & Hardart Children's Hour NBC radio program before doing some vocal work for the Sammy Kaye and Larry Fontaine bands where she used the stage name Cathy Carr. In 1953 she landed her first recording contract with the Coral subsidiary of Decca where she had 3 singles released that year, none of which charted and none of which are in this set (see the Comments below for a complete list of her singles).<br /><br />In 1955 she switched to the much smaller, Cincinnati-based Fraternity Records, launched in 1954 by Harry Carlson, and following two failed singles that year (see Comments), at age 31 she had the honour of delivering their first hit single when, with the backing of the Dan Belloc orchestra, she had Ivory Tower begin a steady climb in Mid-March to # 2 Billboard Pop Top 100 on Fraternity 734 b/w Please, Please Believe Me (omitted here), beating out cover versions by Gale Storm for Dot (# 6) and Otis Williams & His Charms (# 11 - also # 5 R&B). Something called Heartbreak Hotel prevented her from reaching # 1.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing else she did would come anywhere near that success, with Hear Hideaway (again with the Belloc orchestra) only making it to # 67 in August 1956 on Fraternity 743 b/w The Boy On Page Thirty-Five (both here). After five more failed singles at Fraternity to 1958, she re-located to the significantly larger Roulette label where, following a first failed release, she almost made it back to the Top 40 when First Anniversary peaked at # 42 in Feb/March 1959 with the backing of the Hugo Peretti orchestra on Roulette 4125 b/w With Love. Both are omitted here. Later, in June, she had I'm Gonna Change Him stall at # 63 with the backing of the Joe Reisman orchestra on Roulette 4152 b/w The Little Things You Do. Both are here.<br /><br />None among seven more singles at Roulette could get her back on the charts, nor could a 1961 single at Smash and five more at Laurie in 1962/63 (plus one more release in 1967).<br /><br />Sadly, Cathy passed away at age 52 on November 22, 1988.

This recording seems to feature two different performers: Suites 1-3 played in mainstream acceptable tempos and suites 4-6 played so slowly that the sense of pulse seems to be completely missing. It seems that the cellist sees suites 4-6 as being more profound than the first three suites. To these ears, he equates reverential with slow. The prelude to the fourth suite is taken so slowly, I had to fight off the urge to doze. Contrast these performances to Yo Yo Ma's first go at them. The latter were full of life and to this day remain the best available along with the lilting Jean-Guihen Queyras performances.  These works were written by Bach as dance suites. As played by Yo Yo Ma, suites 4-6 are only suitable to be danced by elephants.  If these suites are to be released as single discs, I would recommend suites 1-3, although Yo Yo Ma's first recording betters these.	2011-11-08

Top 5 album of 2011	Build a Rocket Boys is more understated than their previous release, The Seldom Seen Kid, but the scaled down songs seem to carry more emotional punch.  Guy Garvey's voice is one of the real gems in today's musical landscape and his lyrics read like a well written book.  The backing music, stripped down on this release, still has the beautiful and unique orchestrations of their past efforts that blend absolutely perfectly with Garvey's voice.  This is one of those CDs that grabs you and pulls you in with each successive listen.  It's hard to pick out a standout track because they are all so amazing.  Neat Little Rows and Open Arms are probably the two tracks that soar the most and remind you of the vibe from songs that made The Seldom Seen Kid a huge success.  Less grandiose songs like Lippy Kids and the absolutely heart wrenching The Night Will Always Win are what really set the emotional tone for this album.  It is surprising that Elbow's huge success in England has not translated more here in the States because these guys are absolutely superb.  I just saw them in concert and their live performance is simply stunning.	2011-10-02

The sound and style is a bit different in Dresden, and composer Richard Strauss made it quite clear that the Staatskapelle was his personal favorite. The strings are a bit brighter sounding but also more 'burnished' in quality (same can said of the brass, who seldom over-blow). The Dresden woodwinds are outstanding, and their somewhat authentic sounding timpani don't make a practice of over-pounding at every climax. As much as anything, the Staatskapelle benefits from performing and recording in the outstanding acoustics of the Semper Opera, Lukas Kirche and - since renovated - the Frauen Kirche. To the end result of capturing this special Dresden sound and tradition, I love Profil's Staatskapelle Edition. Pretty much every issue has been a jem. That brings us to this release, volume 29.<br /><br />Under the leadership of Britain's Colin Davis, this issue offers comfortable, 'old school' performances of two highly familiar Austro/German standards. If you're looking for revisionist thinking ala the original instrument movement, look elsewhere. There's nothing going on here that's new, ancient or revolutionary. But because I was never satisfied with Kurt Sanderling's rather staid Brahms that he recorded with the Staatskapelle in the early '70s (Eurodisc/RCA), I was anxious to give Colin Davis a try on my favorite one: Brahms 3. Once again, I'm more seduced by the orchestra than by anything that the conductor is doing. Yet, Davis leads a surprisingly relaxed yet logic-driven account of Brahms' fiery and semi-tragic finale. The Dresden strings just shine in the two inner movements, as well as in the second subject of the first movement. Yummm! - me like. The Schubert \\\\\"Unfinished\\\\\", on the other hand, is a bit more surprising.<br /><br />Davis gives a rather weighty and powerful account of the first movement, adopting a prime tempo that's a bit slower than usual (16 minutes). Yet, he clearly picks up the pace in the heavenly second movement which, in spite of its sheer beauty, can easily outlive its welcome when taken too slowly. Davis finishes the \\\\\"Unfinished\\\\\" in just a little over 12 minutes. It's an oddly proportioned performance that works remarkably well. Taken together, Davis' Brahms and Schubert is easy to live with.<br /><br />I've yet to pick up Profil's live performance of Schubert 9 under Colin Davis but I intend to do so soon. Unlike the case with his studio recording for RCA, Davis didn't opt to take every bloody repeat in the last two movements (a big mistake in my book). Thus, rumor has it that it's a big improvement over the RCA issue. For the time being, I'm happy to live with Wolfgang Sawallisch's perfectly respectable Schubert cycle from Dresden (Philips). Meanwhile, this issue may not be essential listening, but it just might lend sufficient pleasure - rather like a fine German Riesling.erful account of the first movement, adopting a prime tempo that's a bit slower than usual (16 minutes).

When you listen to various current artists, their early musical influences tend to come out in their original creations as well as in the songs that originated elsewhere that they cover. So here is a disc full of these current artists playing and singing with the members of Asleep at the Wheel and you can literally hear how much fun they had making this album. That atmosphere is infectious, believe me.<br /><br />I particularly like the production choices and musicianship on this album when I compare it to the formulaic character of today's contemporary Country music. These people don't really sound like anybody else out there today, and that's difficult to achieve in this day and age where the Nashville gunslinger-type studio musicians appear on many recordings a year. Here, the great thing is that in sounding original and unique, they sound A LOT like Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys back in the day.<br /><br />Personally speaking, a hallmark of good Country music is the fact that it makes you want to move, to get up and dance - rather than sit there and listen to it. Because of that, you'll find this one to be a dandy to slam in the CD player and hit the road with. When you listen to this one while driving, it'll put smiles in the miles.<br /><br />Mr. Wills and the boys would be proud...<br /><br />As a companion album to Ride With Bob, I would recommend Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills & the Texas Playboys also by AATW. It also has that real Texas Swing flavor to it. I would actually go so far as to say that if you could only own two albums by Asleep At The Wheel, these babies would be my choices - you can't go wrong with either one.	2010-11-30

From Karl Agell's haunting, Ozzy-like scream, to the absolutely perfect production (particularly of Reed Mullin's superb and varied drum work and Swisher's bass), I don't think there's a dull moment on this album, thematically encapsulated by \\\\\"These Shrouded Temples . . . Remain.\\\\\"    While COC would eventually go overboard with the light interludes on Deliverance, \\\\\"Shallow Ground\\\\\" here perfectly bridges the eastern-tinged speed metal of \\\\\"Mine are the Eyes of God\\\\\" and the heavy distortion of \\\\\"Vote with a Bullet.\\\\\" Yes, that's a real song name on the album! The sheer severity of COC's left-wing lyrical content reaches its zenith here; in subsequent albums it would largely take a backseat to Pepper Keenan's inscrutable \\\\\"poetics.\\\\\"     In every way - lyrics, production, riffs, solos (which never come close to over-the-top guitar heroics but remain more drawn and sorrowful), vocals, and drumming in particular, Blind is a complete metal masterpiece, almost shamefully under-recognized for its contribution to the metal mind.    (Having never owned the CD version, I can't speak to the three bonus tracks.)"	2010-11-10

The harmonica driven \\\\\"All Is Forgiven\\\\\" with special guest Keith Carradine.  \\\\\"Every Single Day\\\\\", is just a pretty pop song (could of been a hit!, and the roots rock of \\\\\"Finding Out\\\\\".

But with Britpop on the way out, their Bowie-Pulp-Scott Walker sound was not in tune with the times. Critics dismissed them as an imitation of Pulp. Now, many years later, even Jarvis doesn't sound like Pulp, and Eliot is still writing dreamy, Beatlesque, cinematic melodies that should resonate with fans of Baroque Pop. He has the magic touch with a melody or hook and his lyrics, although never intense, are stylish and dreamy. Rialto albums were packed with potential singles and this is the same. It has echoes of Eliot's flirtation with country stylings, but overall returns to what he does best - intelligent pop. Try it.	2010-08-05

That is why I was surprised when I went to buy this album and found no reissue. \\\\\"When I Die\\\\\" came out in summer, 1969, and was, I feel, one of the most underrated soul singles of the era.  You may not remember the song, but there would be at least a handfull of \\\\\"Oh, yeah, of courses\\\\\" if I played it. With a beautiful maze of chords and a fistgrip melody, this is soul that edges on jazz complexity.<br /><br />So does the rest of this album. Motherloade may have been riding the David Clayton Thomas Blood Sweat and Tears singles wave of '69, but the jazzy soul and R&B here remind me more of BS&T Mach Al Kooper and [[ASIN:B00004XSVL Child Is Father to the Man]] in its ambition.<br /><br />This album should get a proper reissue but the good news is, this is inexpensive and common on vinyl, and if you don't have a turntable, pick one up to play this."	2010-08-02

If you've never heard of Kenny Poole and have just stumbled onto this page by accident, do yourself a favor and check out his music.

The booklet is of very high quality with very nice photographs of the performers. Great short essay by Rainer Heyink and one also gets short biographies of the performers. The lyrics are available in Italian, English, French and Spanish. Handel's music is very similar to that of J.S. Bach and I love Baroque music for its structure and for being so organized. One never has to guess if it is an adagio or allegro. The sound quality is exquisite and it verily feels as if one is present at the recordings as they were taking place.

It was worth the wait.    I will say straight off that the 90s-ness definitely shows- \\\\\"Kristina\\\\\" falls mainly in the pop opera style that dominated musical theater in the 80s and 90s (the translation is by Herbert Kretzmer, who also wrote the English lyrics of \\\\\"Les Miserables\\\\\"). This serious story, based on a series of novels by Vilhem Moberg, is about Swedish immigrants facing various hardships as they settle in America, and it's certainly more insistently somber and period than most musicals these days.  The plot is episodic, and as this newest version is truncated down to some two and a half hours from the original four(!), one has to assume the cuts have made the plot feel more disjointed than it appeared originally.     The music, though, is fantastic, and actually falls a bit more on the \\\\\"opera\\\\\" side of \\\\\"pop opera.\\\\\" Which is to say, don't come to \\\\\"Kristina\\\\\" to find the pop-rock quality so dominant in \\\\\"Chess.\\\\\" This has a more symphonic sound, mixed in with some folksiness (these are poor immigrants in a mid-1800's setting, after all) and one of the stars, the superb Russell Watson, sings with an operatic tenor.  In comparison, this is more in the mode of the more \\\\\"classical\\\\\" numbers in \\\\\"Chess\\\\\" (\\\\\"You and I,\\\\\" \\\\\"Anthem,\\\\\" \\\\\"A Model of Decorum of Tranquility,\\\\\" etc.).  To be sure, there are some pop-rock inflections here and there, but this is no \\\\\"Mamma Mia!\\\\\" You can, however, expect soaring, emotion-packed melodies that remind you how transporting the best musicals can be.     In addition to Watson, the cast is rounded out by standout performers, including Kevin Odekirk, Louise Pitre, and as Kristina, the phenomenal Helen Sjoholm (who originated the role). Her rendition of \\\\\"You Have to Be There,\\\\\" nearthe end of this two-disc set is downright spine tingling. And there are many other songs to savor in \\\\\"Kristina.\\\\\" If there are a few spots that lag, that's okay: there is so much here of high quality, it feels beside the point- \\\\\"Kristina\\\\\" delivers more memorable numbers than the typical musical score. I don't know if Broadway plans will ever come about, but this is definite confirmation that BB are among the best theater composers we have. I hope we don't have to wait as long for their next show. Or, for that matter, an English translation of a fifteen-year-old show!"	2010-05-04

In a return to \\\\\"Forever Green\\\\\", this album is a complete set of wonderfully pleasant songs that set moods throughout the entire album with actual places and personal feelings.<br /><br />\\\\\"Living In These Mountains\\\\\" is the perfect set starter describing the various seasons, pleasures and pitfalls including lyrics like \\\\\"august sun on your skin\\\\\" and \\\\\"springs promise of new life\\\\\" against the hardship of winters.  Adding a little spoken word, \\\\\"Jamie Savage\\\\\" sings the history of the legendary `Adirondack Chair', a unique comfortable design that has made its way around the world.<br /><br />Songs like, \\\\\"Thank The Earth\\\\\", \\\\\"Back On The Trail\\\\\", \\\\\"Climb Away!\\\\\" along with others all bring forth visceral images of the Adirondacks along with personal lyrics that all describe a story or event.  Legends of the mountains are given fair coverage including \\\\\"Beckett's Joy\\\\\" and the truly fascinating story of John Januck.  \\\\\"Janack's Landing\\\\\" is a bouncy tune with fiddle and banjo that is an ode to John Janack, a colorful Adirondack legend who lost a leg in a mining blast, had one eye, was a fire warden and raised eleven children in the wilds of the Cat mountain area.<br /><br />\\\\\"Perfect Day\\\\\" closes the album with colorful lyrics and just about the prettiest piano accompaniment I've heard in a long time.  It perfectly captures the mood of the mountains, the theme of this album and befits the closing of this third work.  The lyrics, emotion and talented musicians on this album are part of a love affair to the Adirondacks.  Multi-talented Dan Duggan, Dave Ruch and Henry Jankiewicz all accompany Jamie Savage on his musical tour.  Frank Orsini's fiddle winds its magical way throughout the album and vocalist Peggy Lynn's vocals compliment every song she covers.  \\\\\"Back To Nature\\\\\" is a great compliment to \\\\\"Forever Green\\\\\", Savage's first album.

When Staind dropped `Mudshuvel' they immediately built a fan base, but it wasn't until the solemn `Outside' hit airways that they became a household name.  Now, it doesn't matter really who you are, you've heard of Staind in one way shape or form.  Their songs litter the radio waves; they appear on countless magazine covers and back up plenty of soundtracks and film trailers.  Staind has become an international hit, thanks to `Break the Cycle'.<br /><br />That said, this may be my least favorite album they have released.<br /><br />When I say this, I don't mean it in an extremely negative way, because truth be told, Staind is my favorite band out there today and everything they put out I listen to and adore in its own respect, but the one thing that put me off from `Break the Cycle' was the fact that it seemed (at least to me) that the band was trying way too hard here.  Even if collectively the album is better than `14 Shades of Grey' I tend to prefer the latter only because it seems to come a little more natural to the band.  On `Break the Cycle' Staind was trying to find themselves, that balance between the brutality of `Dysfunction' and the melodiousness of their latest effort `The Illusion of Progress'.  What happened, as a result, is an album that feels strangely uneven.<br /><br />So, lets start with the good.  `Outside' sounds completely natural and pristine on all levels.  This is the band that Staind was always meant to be.  Don't get me wrong, I love the raw intensity they brought to `Dysfunction', but the truth of the matter is that this band was never meant to be savage, and the effortless way they sink into the groove of `Outside' is major proof of that.  Same can be said for the massive hit `It's Been Awhile'.  The song is beautifully constructed and highlights the bands massive talent.  It is vocally brilliant and musically impressive.  Following in this same line of melodic passion is `Epiphany', which may be the most beautiful song this band has ever penned.  Aaron Lewis and an acoustic guitar; you can't get any better than that.<br /><br />The there are some tracks that are decent, yet not superb.<br /><br />The album opens up with `Open You Eyes', which is much more commercial than anything off of `Dysfunction' but it sounds as if it fits well.  It seems a little too simple to me, but it is not a bad track by any means.  `For You' was a huge hit for the band, and I can see why, but upon multiple listens it becomes more and more obvious how clich&eacute;d this track really is.  This is not a song to become rooted it.  Yes, it is a good song and it is easy to grab hold of (it is the heaviest song that sounds right on the album, since the other `heavy' tracks sound forced and unnatural, and this does not) but this is not a `great' song.  `Fade' and `Change' possess (possibly) the best vocal work on the album.  The way Lewis allows his voice to caress each and every word can illicit chills, but the fact remains that the tracks themselves don't really hold up over time.  The verses are superb, but the generic commercial way they crafted the chorus lines is a major drawback.<br /><br />Then there are the songs that fall somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />`Safe Place' is a song that I really want to like, one that has a lot of potential, but the downplayed vocals take away from the power this song could have had.  Aaron has one of the greatest voices in the world of rock and roll, yet he doesn't capitalize on them here.  He always appears to be holding himself back.  `Pressure' tries far too hard to be the band Staind was in the beginning, and the end result is less that it could have been.  I abhor the chorus; I like the verses; I love the bridge...in the end I'm indifferent.  The concept behind `Waste' is great, but like `Safe Place' Lewis continues to sound restrained, and restraint is not something this song should have possessed.  If he had just let go a little more the song could have really been a highlight of the album.<br /><br />And then there are the downright bad tracks.<br /><br />`Suffer' just doesn't work on any level.  Aaron's heavy breathing is annoying and out of place and the chorus is so far removed from the track it borders ridiculous.  As bad as `Suffer' is, `Can't Believe' is even worse.  This song tries so hard to be heavy that it just comes off as a really bad garage band trying to be heavy.  Aaron really needs to stay away from screaming.  This is so odd to say, because his brutal vocals in `Dysfunction' were so appropriate and natural, yet here he sounds so out of his element.<br /><br />The album closes with `Take It'.  Now I was really excited when this song kicked into the first verse because it just felt so right.  The guitar work, the bass lines, Aaron's vocals; it just all seemed to fit.  That said; the chorus drags it down a bit.  I won't say it ends on a bad note, but I can't say that it ends as well as I was hoping for.  The chorus almost stops the brilliant progression they were establishing.  Thankfully the bridge actually nails it.  The whole album they were attempting to straddle the fence of heavy and melodic and finally they managed to get it right, to where it felt comfortable.  I just wish the chorus would have done it for me, for then it would have possible been the best track on the album.<br /><br />So, we all know I am a huge fan (like I said; favorite band) but I have to be honest and objective.  Do I like this album?  Yes.  Do I own it and listen to it regularly?  Yes.  Do I consider it a fine testament to the band Staind has become?  Not really.  `Break the Cycle' is a transition piece for me.  It contains a few really good songs and a slew of decent ones with potential, but the bands shaky legs can be seen on many of the tracks as they try to find themselves musically.  I think that `Chapter IV' and `The Illusion of Progress' are more definitive of the band as a whole.  `Break the Cycle' is the bridge to get from here to there.t of the album.<br /><br />And then there are the downright bad tracks.<br /><br />`Suffer' just doesn't work on any level.

So I've been having a trip back to the 50s when I was watching Romper Room & Captain Kangaroo.  Great Britain's Sequel Records have produced an excellent series pulling songs from these two legendary labels that were in the thick of the doo-wop era & early rock and roll.  The Toppers pound the ivories on the double entendre \\\\\"Baby Let Me Bang Your Box.\\\\\"  The Cues' \\\\\"Only You\\\\\" may not have hit the charts, but it is a lovely, sentimental ballad, \\\\\"You live in all of my dreams, You're my every prayer, There'll never be another love for me for I love only you.\\\\\"  The flip side is an uptempo charmer, \\\\\"I Fell for Your Lovin,\\\\\" \\\\\"Humpty Dumpty sitting on the wall, Spied a chick & had a great fall; I felt the same way that Humpty did, When I first saw you, I flipped my lid.\\\\\"  \\\\\"Feeling Low\\\\\" by the Orioles is another lovely track dramatically packed with heartbreak.  \\\\\"Ooh Baby\\\\\" was a B-side by the Teardrops recorded in 1954 that rocks joyfully on a simple guitar riff.  The Clicks' record \\\\\"Peace & Contentment\\\\\" dropped quickly out of sight after its release in 1955, but its gospel groove is a delight.  This is another outstanding volume with some rare nuggets from the 50s.  Enjoy!"	2008-09-30

He learned guitar and accordian. But not taught Flaminco or Gypsy or any determined folk style. By his teens, he was playing in NY Greenwich Village as different, unusual as could be. RCA was looking for a Latin inroads and was interested in the Folk movement + maybe getting a top 40 hit artist in the bargain.    A 45, \\\\\"Everybody do the Click\\\\\",a dance song of the time soon followed. Didn't do much, but an album, \\\\\"The Voice and Guitar of\\\\\" was released. Very popular in Latin countries, Jose sold enough to hang tuff. His quitar technique was amazing, like Segovia sat with Les Paul and giggled.    Then, in 1968, Jose recorded a long strung acoustic version of \\\\\"Light My Fire\\\\\". It hit big. Moms/Dads/Hippies/Bikers/Latinos/Sub-Urbanites all bought it. Romance always sneaks through. Jose found his bliss by re-configuring pop hits to his style i.e.; \\\\\"Sunny\\\\\" \\\\\"CA Dreamin\\\\\" \\\\\"Don't Let the Sun Catch Ya Cryin\\\\\"    This 3 disc CD set has the beginnings of Jose's first recordings on RCA. It has most of the hits and gleans some of the best from his first RCA albums. The sound quality is decent, stereo separation is clear and is an example of '60's Hi-Fi.     What Jose deserves is a box set of his first four RCA albums in their entirety. They are among the best examples of a voice, guitar, ache, and a timeless take of passion"	2008-08-06

After achieving great success in the r&b world with their debut, one song from this album FREE YOUR MIND, garnered heightened attention from the MTV crowd and exposed them to new audiences.<br /><br />En Vogue definitely debuted at a time when there were no girl groups of note in r&b and their stunning 4 part harmonies upped the ante in the game and caused other record labels to scramble to try to find the right combination of young women to rival this group.  This is a solid follow-up to their promising debut album and I'd highly recommend it.<br /><br />Their covers of YESTERDAY, GIVIN HIM SOMETHING HE CAN FEEL & HOOKED ON YOUR LOVE are georgeous solely due to their ability to harmonize so well. My other favorites are the tracks that helped push this album into multi-platinum status:<br /><br />MY LOVIN - YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET IT - timeless classic that sounded like nothing on the radio at that time<br /><br />GIVE IT UP, TURN IT LOOSE - another well constructed mid-tempo track<br /><br />LOVE DON'T LOVE YOU<br /><br />FREE YOUR MIND<br /><br />THIS IS YOUR LIFE	2008-07-05

While there is no possible way \\\\\"Momofuku\\\\\" would ever measure up to [[ASIN:B000S6EYM6 This Year's Model]], it really is the closest Elvis could come to 1978 in 2008.

There's an immediacy to these songs that has been lacking for some time, and hookfests like \\\\\"American Gangster Time\\\\\" or \\\\\"Stella Hurt\\\\\" sink in after just a few listens. The overall sound of the album is a bit rougher than usual, and some of the songs sound like underdeveloped runthroughs (like \\\\\"No Hiding Place,\\\\\" which is still a killer opening gambit).<br /><br />It's also interesting to note that Elvis approached this as an album, releasing it ahead of the download or CD in a vynyl version. The CD case is little more than a miniaturized album sleeve (and a bit disappointing, no booklet, lyrics, etc) with shrunken pictures and a \\\\\"Side One/Side Two\\\\\" track listing.

The title track and the opening track \\\\\"We've only just began\\\\\" were the hits at the time, and today this songs are truly Carpenter's classics. The album also includes some very catchy tunes, among them \\\\\"Reason to believe\\\\\", \\\\\"Mr.Guder\\\\\", the Burt Bacharach songs (\\\\\"I'll never fall in love again\\\\\" and \\\\\"Baby it's you\\\\\", and a version of a Beatles song (\\\\\"Help!\\\\\")that was fantastically made.   My personal favourite is \\\\\"Crescent Noon\\\\\", a song that gives Karen the oportunity to use her rich low vocal register, it's a song I never get tired to listen. Finally, \\\\\"Another Song\\\\\" is a very good number that closes the album, with a fine vocal work, courtesy of Karen, followed by an instrumental part (flutes, keyboards and drums), this song isn't a classic but deserves to be.  As a curiosity, no guitarist is credited but there's an evident guitar part on \\\\\"I kept on loving you\\\\\", so I will thank who tell me who was the guitar player."	2007-11-13

Her voice is what captured my heart and soul back in high school almost twenty years ago.I have finally got the chance to hear one of Loreena's older albums, her winter solstice themed TO DRIVE THE COLD WINTER AWAY. For the first time I was actually not taken with the album right away. The music lacked the haunting melodies that I have come to love in Loreena's music. I had to listen to this cd several times for the music to sink in.<br /><br />What I have noticed on TO DRIVE THE COLD WINTER AWAY is that the general sound of the music is more classical with a hint of mediaval, and lacks the celtic sounds I am so familiar with in recent albums by Loreena. For the first time, I actually found a Loreena McKennitt song I did not like one bit and that was \\\\\"The King\\\\\". Where on earth was Loreena's beautiful voice? Thank heavens the song is rather short. The same can be said about the instrumental \\\\\"Banquet Hall\\\\\" but I rather liked the instrumental more so than \\\\\"The King\\\\\".<br /><br />I really wanted to like this album as much as her more recent albums. TO DRIVE THE COLD WINTER AWAY isn't terrible per say but compared to albums like MASK AND MIRROR and BOOK OF SECRETS, this album falls rather flat in comparison.

The fact that this album was recorded and produced by themselves shows that not only are they amazing musicians, but they are growing in their creative processes.  Songs like \\\\\"Firebreather\\\\\" will recall of The Artist in The Ambulance whereas offerings such as \\\\\"Digital Sea\\\\\" are more along the lines of Vheissu and even beyond.  It's not the same Thrice you may have listened to on Illusion of Safety, but if it was there would be no progression.

In her 50-year career, Peggy Seeger has written many radical songs and put her name to any number of poignant and powerful albums (what's more, she continues to do so), but this one is exceptionally good even by her high standards.

Screaming guitars, poor playing, and poor recording make this a gigantic dissappointment.    I love Stevies music and even she sounds terrible on this.  But I recently saw her in concert and she still sounds great!  So the recording, synthesizing and overdubbing (or whatever) ruined even her on this abomination.  I have to think LB did this on purpose (he produced the album, right?) in attenmpt to put the Mac (and Stevie) out of business to make more room for his mediocre solo efforts.

The entire first side is nothing but one HUGE radio hit after another.  You know the songs.  They are all really good, and take me back to my childhood.   <br /> <br />\\\\\"Money For Nothing\\\\\" NEVER gets old, especially that slow build-up in the beginning.  I remember when me and my parents went looking for a refrigerator one night right after this album came out, and this song always reminded me of that night because of the part when the band mentions a refrigerator in the lyrics.  \\\\\"Walk of Life\\\\\" reminds me of my mom.  GREAT song. <br /> <br />The second side, while initially it seems weaker, it's actually not, and the title song is one of those soothing builder-uper type songs.  It's great.

"\\\\\"Despite the fact that that he had no formal training as a singer (or perhaps because of it), Sinatra developed a highly unique style. The passion that he put into all of his songs could be felt, as well as heard, by the listener. When Frank sang a pop song, your cares melted away. When he sang a ballad, you fell in love. And when Frank was swingin', you couldn't help but dance.\\\\\" ~ Karen Green, Liner Notes ~<br /><br />One of Frank Sinatra's most famous quotes was: \\\\\"I get the audience involved, personally involved in a song because I'm involved myself. It's not something I do deliberately.\\\\\"<br /><br />That's so true! I believe that only the legendary Entertainer of the Century can artfully dramatize the true essence of every song that he recorded during his illustrious and distinguished musical career. So many beautiful songs are identified with him and made them his own as if those songs were written for him and him alone. Like the \\\\\"swingin' songs\\\\\" in this compilation CD, which I bought from one of the nice stores in Solvang, and one of my all-time favorite Sinatra compilation CDs.<br /><br />Listening to all these songs that are perfectly interpreted in a swinging fashion makes me want to put my best foot forward and start dancing to my heart's delight! He sings with enthusiasm that is as infectious as it is overwhelming, and on an instant the listener is transported back to the Dance Band Era.<br /><br />My personal choices include memorable songs such as \\\\\"The Song Is You,\\\\\" \\\\\"You Make Me Feel So Young,\\\\\" \\\\\"Come Fly With Me,\\\\\" \\\\\"Night And Day,\\\\\" \\\\\"I've Got The World On A String,\\\\\" \\\\\"All Of Me\\\\\" and \\\\\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\\\\"<br /><br />This is a delightfully wholesome and beautifully enjoyable compilation CD to savor now and forever!<br /><br />\\\\\"A thing of beauty is a joy forever.\\\\\" ~ John Keats ~"	2007-04-05

Stuff like \\\\\"Adios Amoeba\\\\\" (at least I think that was the name).  Very flat sounding, repetitive and boring, or \\\\\"black and white\\\\\" as another reviewer described it. <br /> <br />This CD has some of the same problems; the first and a couple of other tracks have that repetitive, uninspired beat and percussion loops that just don't interest me at all.   <br /> <br />But some other tracks, the second and a few others, are VERY nice, making me wish he'd stick with their more ambient sound and give the psytrance effort a rest (he's just not very good at it).  The ambient tracks feature a lot of chanting and beautiful singing, and I'd love to hear more of that if anyone can recommend another of his albums. <br /> <br />Finally, I deduct points because, just when I was really enjoying my first listen, I came to track 4 and said, \\\\\"What the f-,\\\\\" as I was suddenly listening to a hip hop track in the middle of my supposedly tribal trance CD.  Not even particularly good hip hop, though I guess I might not be the best judge, since I've never heard any particularly good hip hop. <br /> <br />Anyway, I give this about 3.75 stars (for the good ambient stuff), and I'm at least intrigued enough by that to maybe buy another of his CDs in search of the same."	2007-02-27

For me, it is well worth the wait, being an avid Jamal fan. I have an old mono lp that doesn't have near the superior sound reproduction this cd does. <br /> <br />This album is rather unique in that the string ensemble is supportive rather than dominant or even intrusive as is often the case with similar efforts. Joe Kennedy has done a masterful arranging effort on these tunes.  It is almost like the strings are in conversation with Jamal's piano.  You get everything from up tempo romps like \\\\\"Comme Ci, Comme\\\\\" and \\\\\"Tangerine\\\\\" to ballads like Sophisticated Gentleman and even a bolero beat on \\\\\"Ivy\\\\\". And is there drummer past or present who lay down a bolero beat like Vernel Fourniere could?  <br /> <br />The re-mastering is superior and is in stereo with the most ideal instrument separation imaginable (in my opinion, of course). You get the piano in the middle, bass on the left, drums on the right and the string ensemble separated throughout the full spectrum. I've never heard Israel Crosby this clearly before and I spend considerable time just digging his great bass lines. He was truly a master bassist. <br /> <br />The album is a virtual mini LP with cardboard style jacket and all original liner notes. There is no indication the album is in stereo, but it is! <br /> <br />You don't have to be a Jamal fan to love this album. It is, just simply, very good music. My only significant gripe is that the album is only barely 28 minutes long and Ahmad's solos are therefor very short on most tracks. There are no bonus tracks. Those exceptions along with the price keep me from giving this package more than four stars.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, in spite of the price, I consider this unique cd no brainer recommendation."	2007-01-28

Bajo la direccion, arreglos y produccion de Pepe Luis Soto (Celi Bee), este album, sale por completo del concepto al que nos tenia acostumbrados este grupo disco. De hecho cuenta con una magnifica orquestacion y el mas puro sonio disco de principios de 1979. En algunos momentos llega a sonar como Alec R.

I was so impressed I'm thinking about booking him for a private party next year.  I bought this CD at a closeout sale at Tower Records and it is a gem.   <br /> <br />Rick brings a great facility to the art of solo guitar.  He is technically brilliant but you are not distracted by it--it's all about the music, not the chops.  He does straightforward but fresh versions of several standards, except for a rather unconventional and somewhat outside version of Wave, which only hints at the melody.  As a guitarist, I envy those that can really pull off an entire CD of solo work of rich harmony and improvised lines without leaving big, gaping holes.  I enjoy this CD even more than Joe Pass's Virtuoso series, though it may be sacrilege to say so.  Rick has such a mastery of harmonic structure and voice leading that you forget that you are listening to only one man playing six strings.  I would recommend this CD to any jazz guitar lover, and if you're in the D.C. area you'll want to see him live.	2006-11-20

Jack deJohnette was replaced by Leon (later Ndugu) Chancler, John McLaughlin was \\\\\"replaced\\\\\" by Pete Cosey, and Airto was replaced by Mtume and Don Alias. But Gary Bartz and Keith Jarrett were still there, and it was one of the most intense hour-long sets I have ever heard. Afterwards I went home and listened to the Jack Johnson LP, and realized what was missing - the cohesion the band exhibits on both that album and these Cellar Door Sessions. This was a magic time, in my opinion, for pre-fusion jazz. The right things were happening, and a sort of dark cloud of new inner discovery had descended on musicians both here in the U.S. and overseas, where I was at the time. The Nam war figured heavily in everybody's mind, though we felt that it was reaching its end, and we had somehow helped achieve that. It was almost like that terrible time had sparked a certain creativity in musicians, more adventurous, more \\\\\"in your face\\\\\" than jazz or rock had ever been before, in terms of artistic horizons. By the time I saw Miles for the first time in '71, music was already becoming more corporate, although it would be a few years before the complete annihilation of creative expression via music became a reality.

In the case of Chopin' s four scherzos, there is an epic feature that hardly may be found in his Polonaises; because it's much difficult to feel. It's not an outer expression of boldness or simple patriotic grimace in memory of his beloved country. In these Scherzos there is a powerful inner tension, a sense of dramatic quality and virile intensity like any other previous Opus.<br /><br />To my mind I think these four Op. should be always listened uninterruptedly; considering as part of a superior unity. This spiritual journey finds in Chopin the most relevant evidence of his incisive lyricism and mercurial energy that has nothing to do with that Chopin, frequently depicted as a nostalgic and lonely man, product of the most  refined expression of the Romantic movement.<br /><br />The first is perhaps the strongest of the set, filled of bravura passages and expression. The second owns memorable episodes filled of mercurial vibes, and the third is the most introspective.<br /><br />The four scherzo is visibly the saddest and existential of the set. It is loaded of heroic tragedy, tinged of crepuscular lyricism, that might be well considered as an epilogue, where the struggling conflicts have been left behind as if the hero was writing his personal memories. There is a restrained rage but it's far to be similar to the experimented in the battlefield.<br /><br />This is the first time we may appreciate with all his powerful intensity and supreme majesty the whole set, magisterially performed by Sviatoslav Richter whose nervous and epic musculature remains until this date as the closest vision that William Kapell made in the early fifties in an unavailable recording taken from the air; thanks to the invaluable and generous kindness of Rafael Sylva a first-rate dilettante who had the honor of meeting personally to Willie in both performances in Caracas in 1948 and 1949 respectively.<br /><br />The most important aspect to remark is that part of this historic set of Kapell I have not heard about any other set of Scherzos performed with such incandescence level and astonishing commitment like this one. Richter was in his 62 and the performance level is exciting, mesmerizing and absorbing.<br /><br />If there is an emblematic composition that reflects with  kaleidoscopic sensuality and magnificent employment of light and shadows game in all the piano's literature of Schumann, maybe Bunte blatter would respond this question.  Respect  this Op. 99 I have to express my most profound admiration for such colossal achievement. Recorded in 1971, this work finds in Richter a performer who captured the essential core of the work as nobody else at least until now. This memorable version is filled of nocturnal lyricism, twilight flavor and sheer &eacute;clat.  Curiously, this has always been an Op. totally neglected by most pianists, and I still ask myself the reason why.<br /><br />In sum, this is a fantastic album that covers two remarkable years  where the febrile, volcanic and mercurial pianism of Richter was under the service of the most refulgent poetry and admirable lyricism respect previous decades.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended.

US	20828254	RCSL59KJV8TBB	B000EHRAXY	534993563	Chosen Lords	Music	5	4	11	N	N	Review by John Bush	"In 2001, when Aphex Twin fans got what they'd been hoping for -- a new album -- they soon learned that not every Aphex Twin work was pure genius. (Granted, they'd heard very little evidence of mediocrity before that point.) Drukqs was a rambling wreck of an album, a hodgepodge of material that appeared to have been plundered from at least three distinct periods, stretching over a full decade of Richard D. James' career. The Analord series of 12\\\\\" singles, inaugurated with January 2005's Analord 10 and eventually including ten additional volumes, was much different. It proved that James was still capable of brilliance -- not just scattered brilliance, but consistently excellent and occasionally stupendous work. The Analord material was throwback acid techno that moved at a fast pace and showed evidence of a malevolent streak behind it, just like the Aphex commercial breakouts Come to Daddy and Windowlicker. Fortunately, while the Analord singles featured much in the way of melody and subtlety, they lacked the cartoonish imagery that marred those two EPs (particularly the vocals and the video clips). More so even than \\\\\"Come to Daddy,\\\\\" the Analord material found Aphex Twin returning to the music of his early career; stylistically, it's the logical follow-up to James' Caustic Window and Analogue Bubblebath material of the very early '90s, which attempted to (and usually succeeded in) creating the freakiest techno ever produced, without either deserting a steady beat or straying into self-conscious experimentation. Whether embracing a novelty (he covered the early-'70s synth hit \\\\\"Buttered Popcorn\\\\\") or pursuing highly evocative techno (the forerunner of IDM), the Caustic Window material was some of the best work of his or any other producer's career. Just one caveat: Chosen Lords serves to compile a few highlights from the Analord series, but not all of them, and it includes less than 25 percent of the material; vinyl is still the way to hear those tracks, and this compilation is simply an introduction to the 11 separate 12\\\\\" releases.  <br />"	2006-06-09

But honestly they all have some talent and major guts to get as far as they did. So lets give them credit here, they all deserve it. <br />With that said lets go: <br />Melissa Mcghee- What about Love- I love her voice. It's sexy and she can sing. She left way to early. I hope she finds success. 5/5 <br />Bucky Covington- Superstition. How can anyone not like this kid. He seems so sincere and down to earth. I liked his voice. I think Bucky has what it takes to succeed. Decent voice. cute and very likable. Way to go Bucky. 4/5 <br />Mandisa- I'm Every Woman. Not a big Mandisa fan. She has a nice voice but I don't think it was great recorded. She most likly sounds great in person. She seems confident and smart. Hope she'll do well in maybe gospel 3/5 <br />Chris Daughtry- Wanted Dead or Alive. Loved Chris from the start. Don't love this song. He sounds ok. But not as well as expected. He'll go far I'm sure 3/5 <br />Ace Young- Father Figure. Liked Ace from the start. I think his good looks both helped him and hurt him. But if you just judge the vocals he's the best on this CD. His recording voice is better then when he sang on the show.Its sexy and smooth. He will hopefully get a CD out fast and do well.5/5 *Note to future good looking american idols. If your cute don't give a sexy stare into the camera at the end of your song. Some people love it, but an equal number it turns off. If your hot, your hot it will come across. <br />Tayloe Hicks-Takin it to The streets. Decent. He seems like he is better in person. Don't get his appeal but many do so I'm sure we will be hearing alot of him.3/5 <br />Lisa Tucker- Sighned sealed, She's very pretty and talented but I don't think this song is done well. 2/5 <br />Kellie Pickler- Walkin After Midnight, Another cute girl, who can sing county decent. But that describes half of Nashville. Nothing really outstanding here. Hopefully others disagree. She seems sweet good luck toher.2/5 <br />Elliott Yamin- Moody's Mood for Love  Elliott has a great sexy voice. Its hot. Love him. Hope he does well. He should write a book about his life. Everyone loves an underdog story. Good Job. <br />5/5 <br />Katharine Mcphee- Think,  did not like. She is beautiful and sang great on the show. Her recording voice in this song is not that good. She seems suited for broadway.2/5 <br />Parris Bennett- Midnight Night Train to Gerogia, She does have a strong voice. I don't like her style or the song. But if that type of style is your thing, She is good. 3/5 <br />Kevin Covais- When I fall in Love. What can I say Kevin has guts and can sing ok. Should he be on a cd? Well hey, its America so why not.  He sems like a smart kid hope he does well. <br />Thats it. Its worth the money, nice summer type music. Enjoy	2006-05-28

Here's the details on them: <br /> <br />CONCRETE AND STEEL--A great song to start the album off with. It gives a very good impression of what is to come on the rest of the tracks. Featuring lyrics by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill. <br /> <br />LOVETHING--Even better than CONCRETE AND STEEL. Some perfectly-chosen guitar riffs in between the lyrics of the chorus, plus a very good tune in addition. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill. <br /> <br />PENTHOUSE EYES--This song doesn't quite live up to the previous two. It's a good song, just the music behind the singing is a bit dull. The singing that covers it up doesn't do much to make it more exciting either. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard. <br /> <br />TELL IT--This song is along the same lines as PENTHOUSE EYES. It's just not as exciting as LOVETHING or CONCRETE AND STEEL. The slow, unanimated singing just isn't quite what began the album. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill. <br /> <br />MY HEAD'S IN MISSISSIPPI--This is the deepest we've heard Billy Gibbons's voice as since 1981, in TUBE SNAKE BOOGIE. Anyway, this is somewhat of a bluesy-rock update of 1973's LA GRANGE, sung by Frank Beard. It's a very good song, but nothing similar to what we've heard on the album yet in any way. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons. <br /> <br />DECISION OR COLLISION--Finally another song with a rock sound similar to that of the rest of the album's that actually has fast, animated singing and music! Though this isn't quite as good as the first two songs, at least it has the exuberant sound that we started out with! Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill. <br /> <br />GIVE IT UP--This is a rather different type of music than the rest as well, but it's just about as good as LOVETHING. In fact, it might even be better. Great tune, clever lyrics. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill. <br /> <br />2000 BLUES--Talk about too slow. This song is meant as a sad one and well accomplishes being so. Way too well. It comes out sounding depressed rather than saddened. It's just WAY too slow and saddened. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons. <br /> <br />BURGER MAN--A very good song, about as good as CONCRETE AND STEEL. Some very interesting lyrics, probably written as a joke. Who knows? Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill. <br /> <br />DOUBLEBACK--The saved it for last: the absoloute best song on the album. Fantastic rock and roll, fabulous chorus, pretty much everything about it is great. One song that just can't be beat. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill.	2006-02-06

I had a bad first impression when I saw them playing \\\\\"City Of Blinding Lights\\\\\" on MTV, which I found too corny and over-dramatic for my taste. After I bought the album and listened, I changed my opinion. \\\\\"Miracle Drug\\\\\" is the first song you should listen. It's a great power tune with inspired guitar riffs and fantastic dynamics. \\\\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\\\\" is a very touching song Bono wrote about his relationship with his late father. It has got a terrific guitar tremolo and Bono singing at the top of his lungs. \\\\\"All Because Of You\\\\\" is THE U2-anthemic-rock'n'roll song at its best. This album was made by a mature band who knows what they're doing, and you can feel that while you listen -- it is also filled with melody, mood and above-average lyrics.

"Upon hearing that the LA Guns would continue on without lead guitarist and founding member Tracii Guns, my initial reaction was \\\\\"are you kidding me?\\\\\" While the band has replaced every other single member since its inception, from the days of when Axl Rose and later Paul Black fronted the band, the loss of Tracii Guns seemed a bit much. While the band continued without singer Phil Lewis for a few years in the 90s, as long as they had Tracii, to me it was still the LA Guns.  It seemed like the LA Guns without Tracii would be like Van Halen without Eddie Van Halen.<br /><br />With the release of the Brides of Destruction sophomore album \\\\\"Here Come the Brides\\\\\" (2005) and the LA Guns first official studio album without Tracii (excluding last years covers album) the verdict is in. Tracii Guns was not LA Guns and the new lineup is managing just fine. The new Brides CD shows that Tracii, while a good guitar player, is not that great of a songwriter and needs to collaborate with other musicians in order to make memorable music. As far as the new LA Guns is concerned, unless someone told me Tracii wasn't in the band, I would have no way of knowing otherwise. Even without Tracii Guns, \\\\\"Tales from the Strip\\\\\" (2005) has the same LA Guns signature sound that fans are sure to love. It's as thought the band were in a vacuum, completely unaware that it is 2005. It's a totally retro, sleazy, pop-metal album which sounds as though it came straight from 1988. The band; Phil Lewis, (vocals) Stacey Blades, (guitar) Adam Hamilton (bass) and Steve Riley (drums) have cooked up a stellar collection of pop-metal songs that fans of the genre are sure to love. It's a semi-concept album, its theme being tales from LA's infamous sunset strip. It's a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining listen.<br /><br />While the band has gone though numerous lineup changes over the years, with varying results, \\\\\"Tales from the Strip\\\\\" is one of the band's best offerings. If you are a fan of the band or 80s pop-metal in general, \\\\\"Tales from the Strip\\\\\" is probably going to be your favorite album of 2005.s pop-metal in general, \\\\\"Tales from the Strip\\\\\" is probably going to be your favorite album of 2005.        <br />"	2005-12-11

But, I love the Aria \\\\\"Nessun Dorma.\\\\\"  And, even though she butchers the Italian, Aretha does a GREAT job with this piece. <br /> <br />The whole reason she sang the piece in the first place was because Luciano Pavarotti got sick the night of the Grammys.  She filled in for him, having never sung the piece before.  Knowing that, she did an awesome job. <br /> <br />She is the undisputed king of soul.  And, it's nice to see someone as good as she is take a risk once in a while."	2005-09-26

Isn't there a way reviewers can warn people about the copy-protected disc...WITHOUT penalizing the band/music with 1,2 or 3 star reviews?  This is at least a 4(maybe 5) release easily.  The copy-protection is bad i know, but the music.....<br /><br />Did you like the Happy Mondays/Stone Roses/Charlatans/Inspiral Carpets Britpop/rock of the 90's?  Do you like recent UK acts like The Music and Soul Hooligan?  Do you enjoy trippy, catchy, cool, hip, body-movin', psychadelic, up-tempo songs that rock?  If yes, find a way to buy or borrow this excellent cd.  To me, they sound like a BETTER version of The Music(Kasabian's singer has a less grating voice and their music is tighter, more distinct) but with an electronic edge akin to Soul Hooligan(though to a lesser dgree) with the added extra bonus of the swagger and pomp of a Stone Roses or Happy Mondays.  If you still aren't convinced, click on the music samples and check'em out(they're free),  but if you can't:<br /><br />* Club Foot- great energetic song, i see why people love this one but...(A)<br /><br />* Processed Beats-...gets my vote for track of the album!  ultra-catchy, trippy # that gets you high with no need for chemical substances. (A)<br /><br />* Reason is Treason- really good, fast pop-sounding song.

(B)<br /><br />* Test Transmission- starts kinda slow...then goes into hyper-catchy mode after he starts singing.  you just feel good listening to so many distinct, catchy, fun yet edgy, groovable and movable songs!  sorry, got carried away there.

RBX, who came up with Snoop & Tha Dogg Pound during the Death Row era of the early 90's, never really had a breakthrough solo effort despite a ghastly flow and an ominous voice. \\\\\"Ripp Tha Game Bloody\\\\\" has a few decent tracks but is far too guest-heavy to be considered a solo album. All-star appearances by Snoop on \\\\\"Tell It! (The Remix)\\\\\" and Daz on \\\\\"Jus... Murda\\\\\" are pretty underwhelming but his collabo with former Doggystyle artist, E. White on \\\\\"They Run\\\\\" is the highlight here. There are some other worthwhile tracks like \\\\\"Summer In The City\\\\\", \\\\\"Crime\\\\\", \\\\\"RBX\\\\\", and \\\\\"Picasso\\\\\", but for the most part, the album is nothing special.

Most of the reviews gave this album some incredible marks so I had high expectations going into my 1st audition. Usually when I have high expectations, I am easily disapointed in the final result, but not this time. While not the biggest TNT fan, I have both Intuition and Tell No Tales and thought very highly of both albums. This release blew me away. I think I can honestly say that I dug every track on it. I've always thought that Tony Harnell had an incredible voice, but must admit that at times, his voice would eventually grate on my nerves hitting high note after high note. Well, it appears that he has been able to tone it down a notch on this album and the results are just what I needed. Ronnie's ability on the guitar have always been technically awesome, but he seam's to have had the reins released  here. In closing, I've never heard an album in which I liked every song on it. There was always a track or 2 that left me saying \\\\\"they must be filling space here\\\\\". Not here. I can easily say that I loved every song on it. If you've never heard of TNT before, but enjoy great melodic rock from the 80's, you owe it to yourself to pick up this title. You won't be disappointed."	2005-05-29

Although this album is supposed to be a concept album in its own, the material on it is heavily varied and vocals are strange to the extreme.  Many things are present on this recording that would seem totally out of place on El Cielo, such as a more aggressive edge, the occasional scream, etc.  This is reputedly a demo, and that's believable while at the same time amazing due to the thought and creativity that obviously went into this record.  \\\\\"Movement I\\\\\" flows perfectly into \\\\\"Lechium\\\\\" which in turn leads into the awesome \\\\\"Crosswind Minuet\\\\\".  These songs all utilize in full Dredg's unique melodic style, which included bits of latin and jazz almost reminiscient of \\\\\"Children of Sanchez\\\\\" esque numbers, while at the same time remaining heavier than anything on El Cielo.  The lyrics are for the most part not audible or prominent other than in \\\\\"Symbol Song\\\\\" (take these words be on your way and you will falter not), and often not present at all.  Gavin chooses to use strange vocal styles or be mixed far in the background, bringing the focus to the intruments.  On El Cielo every instrument had equal emphasis, including his voice, which improved much for that CD.  \\\\\"Traversing through the Arctic Cold\\\\\" is a simple yet brilliant bass/piano/drum instrumental, perfectly creating a mood.  \\\\\"Intermission\\\\\" would be in vein of the first few tracks, except that the vocals are inexplicably quiet.  \\\\\"Penguins in the Desert\\\\\" is classic and remains the only real Dredg headbanger track.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you don't know about this band, buy El Cielo.  They can be called similar to Radiohead in instrumentation and experimentalism, but have their own mission and style, very interesting lyrics.  If you like that album, then buy this."	2005-04-15

I hate to mention certain ones without appreciating the rest. This whole album is just so good. This band, led by Imogene Heap is awesome. I expect their future releases to be just as perfect.

No other star achieved this status as a solo artist.    Full version of this compilation was released outside the U.S.A. as an excellent profuse two-CD set with almost all her UK & US hits from all labels she recorded for and some rarities as well. Unfortunately this is one-CD US version, which contains only 21 of her hits.    It's an interesting done compilation, but three songs should be replaced by much bigger hits. It could contain all Cher's US Top 10 hits (from both \\\\\"Billboard\\\\\" charts: Hot 100 and Singles Sales) and these US singles, which went to Top 10 only in the UK. 20 songs in total. It means that hits: \\\\\"You Better Sit Down Kid\\\\\", \\\\\"The Way Of Love\\\\\", \\\\\"Love And Understanding\\\\\" and \\\\\"When The Money's Gone\\\\\" should be added instead of less popular \\\\\"Heart Of Stone\\\\\", \\\\\"Save Up All Your Tears\\\\\" and \\\\\"A Different Kind Of Love Song\\\\\".    Fans can also find here two the biggest Sonny & Cher's hits, \\\\\"I Got You Babe\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Beat Goes On\\\\\", what is brilliant completion of this collection.    Cher has released so many collections of hits so far that her every fan should be very exacting in selecting the best one. \\\\\"The Very Best Of\\\\\" is the most perfect, because it sums up forty years of her career. Of course, it's better to choose its comprehensive double CD version with 42 hits. But if you want to have only the most important songs of Cher, in both studio and live versions, you can choose special US edition with bonus live disc from her farewell tour.

In Holland, they were able to rack up a bunch of hit singles (many of them not available on any non-compilation albums) and release great prog rock albums in the process. I first got exposed to Earth & Fire as a kid when my dad bought the LP of To the World of the Future (1975), since none of my family ever been to Holland, my dad bought that album either mistaking them for Earth, Wind & Fire, or simply liked the futuristic '70s artwork (he wasn't exactly the most musically informed person out there). Of course by that point, the band was starting to explore disco, but still hadn't quite abandoned prog. <br /> <br />In 1970, the band released their self-entitled debut. And just to let everyone know, the one with the Roger Dean cover is not the original pressing, that was a 1971 UK pressing on the Nepentha label, and of course that's the cover used for the German Repertoire label CD reissue, as well as the newer Japanese reissue. The original Dutch LP was released on Polydor/Medium (has the same familiar red Polydor label, with the \\\\\"Medium\\\\\" logo under the \\\\\"Polydor\\\\\" logo) and featured a gimmick matchbox cover, which shows a picture of the band, and when you fold open the cover, you see matches, and a list of the songs. This album is less polished than their following (ie. Song of the Marching Children, Atlantis) and there's plenty of that late '60s psych elements still left. The band consisted of female vocalist Jerney Kaagman, with twin brothers Chris Koerts on guitar and Gerard Koerts on organ and flute, with drummer Ton van der Kleij and bassist Hans Ziech. This album managed three hits, \\\\\"Seasons\\\\\", \\\\\"Ruby is the One\\\\\", and \\\\\"Wild and Exciting\\\\\". \\\\\"Seasons\\\\\" and \\\\\"Ruby is the One\\\\\" featured original drummer Cees Kalis (Ton v.d. Kleij hopped on board once they started recording their debut LP), since both of those were released as a single prior to the album's release, \\\\\"Seasons\\\\\" being their first ever release, released at the end of 1969 (\\\\\"Hazy Paradise\\\\\" was the B-side, and \\\\\"Mechanical Lover\\\\\" was the flip side of \\\\\"Ruby is the One\\\\\"). \\\\\"Love Quiver\\\\\" is the one cut that bears a striking resemblance to Jefferson Airplane, but unlike the Airplane, you get treated with a great organ solo. \\\\\"What's Your Name\\\\\" is a laid-back acoustic piece with flute. And there's lots of times that \\\\\"21st Century Show\\\\\" is called \\\\\"21st Century Land\\\\\", because of the previous cut entitled \\\\\"Vivid Shady Land\\\\\", but it's actually entitled \\\\\"21st Century Show\\\\\". \\\\\"Seasons\\\\\", as mentioned, dates from 1969, and wasn't written by either of the Koerts brothers or E&F members, but George Kooysman of Golden Earring (who supported E&F, and helped them get a deal with Polydor, in which Golden Earring recorded for). \\\\\"Twilight Dreamer\\\\\" sounds like a precursor to \\\\\"Carnival of the Animals\\\\\" (from Song of the Marching Children) and near the end what sounds like the band's first ever use of a synthesizer (sounds like a Moog). \\\\\"Vivid Shady Land\\\\\" is a perfect example of the band still sticking to that late '60s psychedelic sound. <br /> <br />On the Repertoire CD reissue, you have the complete album, which ends with \\\\\"What's Your Name\\\\\" (track 9), and then you have a whole bunch of bonus cuts, all non-album singles, all the way up to 1976, where the band decided to go disco. You get \\\\\"Hazy Paradise\\\\\", \\\\\"Mechanical Lover\\\\\", the ever wonderful \\\\\"Invitation\\\\\" (one of my favorite non-album singles the band released) and the equally wonderful Mellotron-oriented \\\\\"Memories\\\\\". You also get the original single version of \\\\\"Song of the Marching Children\\\\\", which was released several months before the album's release, and what separates this version from the album version is Jerney Kaagman's singing sounds different. \\\\\"Lost Forever\\\\\" (flip side of \\\\\"Storm and Thunder\\\\\") and \\\\\"From the End 'till the Beginning\\\\\" (flip side of \\\\\"Memories\\\\\") are also featured. Missing here is \\\\\"Tuffy the Cat\\\\\" (flip side of \\\\\"Love of Life\\\\\"), but I guess they couldn't include that because of lack of space, thanks to all the other bonus cuts. Then they included two songs from where the band went disco, \\\\\"Thanks For the Love\\\\\" (1975) and \\\\\"What Difference Does it Make\\\\\" (1976), complete with strings, horns and hi-hats. Unfortunately Earth & Fire fell victim in the late '70s by recording increasingly commercial material, and you know it's time to run when comparisons to ABBA start surfacing (but it didn't hurt the band in terms of success, although it's understood that most prog rock fans don't usually bother with much anything they released after 1975). Regardless, this CD is a wonderful historical document, not just for the debut, a great album that shows even better things to come, but you get lots of non-album singles as well."	2005-01-11

Listen, \\\\\"Master of Puppets\\\\\" can't be remade...get over it! Neither can any other previous album, they are pieces of rock history and we should leave them be. We can only look to the future for newer Metallica, and if St. Anger isn't your taste...fine...don't buy it. But don't go around saying they \\\\\"suck now\\\\\" or \\\\\"sold out\\\\\", because that is just pissing on their legacy, imo. I personally think that current hard rock sucks (with Korn as an exception), so we should be thankful that we still have this great band around. This record is total \\\\\"jam/garage\\\\\" stuff. I truly believe that if the band had told the world that that was what they were going for, that this backlash of negative attention would be non-existant! Give it a shot, if u don't like it...stick to their other cd's. But Metallica still kicks ass!"	2004-11-12

"Yes..Mase is back but ive noticed that he has received a lot of flack and criticism because it doesnt sound like Harlem World and because its more of a club album then a gospel album. Mason Betha aka Mase is now a pastor and has changed his life around for the better and showin his faith for the Lord Jesus Christ and since that's the case he has been welcomed but also hated too. Cam'ron and Jim Jones of the Diplomats dont like Mase and Cam'ron even went on BET Rapcity and dissed Mase right on TV. Sure this isn't a gospel record and he is dancing in the Breathe, Stretch, Shake video with women but he's not doing anything illegal or bad. I give da man props! Mase's cd has no offensive content, no foul language, no references to violence and no offensive comments towards women like his first 2 albums. Now i did notice that he was talkin about money a lot but if you really listen to the songs he's really explaining the effects that money can have on a person and their lives. I see a transformation and for those puttin him down..well ill say it like this.. Mase is a rapper not a gospel singer..ok..and if he made a gospel record i doubt anyone would really buy it and if you dont think that he doesnt give thanks or acknowledge the Lord then just listen to \\\\\" Gotta Survive\\\\\", easily his most personal song on the album and also my personal favorite. And as a christian im not gonna hate on him plus he also wrote a book called \\\\\" Revelations\\\\\" givin thanks to the Lord. Don't Be Hatin! Mase proves that you can put out a positive message and give thanks to the Lord Jesus Christ and still be popular and sell lots of records. <br /> <br />Now to the album itself Mase is just as good as ever and proves that you dont have to talk about shootin and killin people in ya album in order to not only sell records but also make good music. There are a few fillers on this album of course and another downfall is that there's only 12 songs on this album. But i do strongly recommend everyone to buythis cd. <br /> <br />The highlights on this album are: <br />1) Welcome Back ( Livin da vida without da loca)I like this song!..Really catchy and reminds me of a mixture between Jay-Z's Hard Knock Life and any Will Smith song...lol..! 4.5/5 <br />2.)Breathe,Stretch,Shake: Easily the best club hit on here 4.5/5 <br />3.)Gotta Survive: I like the piano playin in this song it goes well.. Best Song on da cd 5/5 <br />4)I Owe: It's All Mase...different beat..but i like it 4/5 <br />5)Money Comes and Goes: Very Catchy Song! 4.5/5 <br />6)Into What You Say:4/5   <br />7)My Harlem Lullaby (Most would say that this is the best song on the album but i strongly disagree..the 6 songs above that i've mentioned i think are far better: 3.5/5"	2004-09-20

His flow is the fastest and most rythymic.    2.WISH BONE: 4.5/5- Supringly Wish Bone is the second best on this album. His lyrics are great and his voice suits most of the songs.    3.KRAYZIE BONE: 4/5- Krayzie Bone just didn't stand out on this album. There are quite a few songs where he say's cheesy sounding lyrics. But his flow is quite fast.    4.LAYZIE BONE: 4/5- A bit of a disapointing performance by Layzie Bone, although there are a few songs where Layzie really stands out, but on most of the songs he dosen't do that much. On most Bone Thugs N Harmony albums he's the best though.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"	2004-09-12

They had only had three previous albums before this, and in my opinion that is too soon for a compelation album.  Fastball is still a young band with, hopefully, more albums to come.  They are a great band and I love their music.  I would give this CD five stars for the material, but I take away a star simply because they haven't had enough albums for a compelation.	2004-06-22

Much of the blame for this lies on their new frontman Howard Jones. He can get the job done on the hardcore vocals but, more often than not, sucks on the clean ones. The fact that Howard isn't as good as Jesse Leach becomes very obvious on the best song on the album, Take This Oath, in which Jesse is the guest vocalist. The music, while heavier than AOJB, is much more simplistic. There is rarely a moment when it deviates from the regular KSE formula and does something truly unpredictable. Overall, this a good effort considering what they had to work with, though they'll probably never surpass AOJB unless they somehow reunite with Jesse.	2004-06-15

After blessing us fans with tight albums and cememting his position as one of the greatest of all time, he decides that he's said everything he could possibly say and that it's time to retire. With The Black Album, I was kind of expecting a 5 star classic. It is one? Well, you'll find out in this review.<br />Album Highlights: Plenty to name here. December 4th, What More Can I Say, Encore, Moment of Clarity, Justify My Thug, Lucifer, and My 1st Song.<br />Production: Thumbs up. <br />Lyrics and Subject Matter. Thumbs up. As usual, Jigga is on point with the lyrics and subject matter.<br />Originality: Thumbs up, but slightly.<br />The Last Word: You'd think that with everything being thumbs up that this would make an easy candidate for 5 stars. Sadly, it isn't, but it's an EXCELLENT album, and it's a great way for Jigga to exit the game. Even after his retirement, hip hop seems MAD WEAK without him(even though we still have my favorite MC Nas, and others). I truly think it's his last and I wouldn't be surprised if he returns to bless us with a new album. Recommended.	2004-04-22

Aside from the decent things that were released, such as Jay-Z's last album, 50 Cent's album, etc, NOTHING came out, and hip hop seems to be getting weaker and weaker EVERYDAY. So, Black Moon, a tight group that's been in the game for a decade now, drops this album in the midst of this wack hip hop that's going on, and they don't disappoint. I wasn't expecting this album to be better than their first album(Enta Da Stage), but it comes close in doing so. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: Not too much filler here, but the highlights are Stay Real, Looking Down the Barrel, Fever(an example of a TIGHT song that's TOO SHORT), Confusion, That's The Way S*** Iz, Why We Act This Way, That's How It Iz, Where It Goes Wrong, What Would You Do, Pressure Iz Tight, and This Goes Out To You. Everything else still is worth listening to.<br />Production: Thumbs way up for the Beatminerz' production.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Buckshot is STILL lyrically gifted today and 5FT lays down some hot lines as well. <br />Originality: Thumbs up. You still get the same old Black Moon here, but it seems so fresh and new(obviously) in a way.<br />The Last Word: Although this album won't achieve the sales figures it deserves, this is still an excellent album from Black Moon. They are tight just the way they are. They don't need to sell out or go pop, and that's way they have such supporters today. You can't ask for much more than that. They stay real, just like the first song on this album says. Strongly recommended.	2004-04-22

It had bits and pieces of greatness and ideas for a few albums. It ended up sounding like a band going in ten different directions at once. They are one of the true Britpop bands of 1995 to still be going as strong as ever, and they even bothering touring in America every few years. Life On Other Planets immediately sounds like a more cohesive piece of work. They have focused on their greatest moments of the past and turned it into real songs. Their ability to update some of the unfinished business of mid-Bowie (Aladdin Sane) and turn it into something of their own is amazing. Of course Supergrass has more time to work on guitar sounds and probably better studios. &quot;Seen The Light&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot; are some of their best songs ever. There is a lot of good fun and games with Supergrass: &quot;Never Done Nothing Like That Before&quot; is them at their punk best and wildest. Many of their contemporaries have no sense of humor. They seem to have used more piano in their songs from their secret fourth member. They even use Beatlesque harmonies in the last song &quot;Run&quot; which blows away most groups in the vocal department. What can you say? Every song is a hit!<br />([...]	2004-04-20

Him and Ludacris always make a good match for a Hip-Hop/R&amp;B hit. The rest of the album tho had it's moments. Ballads like &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Can You Handle It&quot; are very nice and true to his form from the last album. The other slow songs &quot;Throwback&quot;, &quot;Confessions Pt.2&quot;, and &quot;That's What It's Made For&quot; a very good the have nice tempo and good lyric content. They make for for very good songs that could be singles in there own right. Also the mid-tempo &quot;Caught Up&quot; is great and should be the next single after &quot;Burn&quot;. The rest of the album just didn't seem to match these and are seen in my eyes as album fillers. I like Usher I just think he was half an album away from the title of a truly classic album. But he definately did some good work on this album and it is worth the buy.	2004-03-28

This guy composed all the songs in the album save for &quot;Polka Dots and Moonbeams.&quot; He has this innate feel for jazz and his voice is a showier Peter Cincotti, with a less heavy drone unlike Connick and he also has this fragile upper registers when reaching for that high note.

Red Hot Chili Peppers has been around for a long time and I think that people who have just started getting into the band should purchase this album.

Some people, before buying the CD, might think that the two new songs that are on the album might not be the same quality as the other classic hits. Yet, they are very wrong. The two new songs on the album, &quot;Fortune Faded&quot; the single and &quot;Save the Population&quot; are great songs and I'm glad they are on this CD.

After watching the American Idol series, watching her develop through each week's performance, there has been much growth of talent and maturity from Clarkson.  This CD has become one of my favorites that I frequent wherever I am, either my car, at work, wherever. \\\\\"Thankful\\\\\" is something that I would recommend not to easily overlook.  <br />1. The Trouble With Love Is: honestly, this song was not initially one of my favorites.  It took a while for me to get used to listening to it, and to eventually to like it.  This song, currently Clarkson's third single, top 10 MTV TRL, does showcase her vocals.  Her strong clear vocals are clearly demonstrated within this song.  Not only that, but having co written this song, shows some of her aesthetic talent. Will eventually get good.<BR>\\\\\"My heart keeps calling, and I keep on falling...\\\\\"<BR>4/5<BR>  <BR>2. Miss Independent: the first single that was released and was highly successful as it was the song that started the success of \\\\\"Thankful\\\\\".  This song's lyrics are very catchy, as the chorus is very edgy and `rockish'.  Having Co-Written this song with Christina Aguilera, Kelly has made this song one of her trade marks.  Very catchy bass and great bridge.<BR>\\\\\"When Miss Independent walked away, no time for love that came her way...\\\\\"<BR>5/5<br />3. Low: another rock inspired song that showcases Kelly's vocal talents.  This is Clarkson's second single release.  It wasn't that successful with the musical audience, but I still very much like it.  I enjoy the electric guitar in this piece that creates a pulsating tune.  I think there is intelligence musical ornamentation within this piece, which can be small and less detailed, but if you pay attention you can hear it.<BR>\\\\\"I've walked out of this darkness, with much sense of regret...\\\\\"<BR>5/5<br />4. Some Kind Of Miracle: another song that took several times for me to like.  Although this song was \\\\\"boring\\\\\" to me, it has a very catchy melodythat just stuck with me until I eventually enjoyed it. The music is very soft and is given emphasis with the beating of the drum and the bass.  Great vocals.  <BR>\\\\\"You came and gave me the love that I need\\\\\"<BR>4/5<br />5. What's Up Lonely: This song, is catchy, but not as all others.  Of all the other tracks, I would think this is my least favorite.  The music-drum beat, bass line, etc. and the singing becomes very redundant and becomes boring after a while.  <BR>\\\\\"Just when I think that you're gone, you're in the mirror looking back...\\\\\"<BR>2/5<br />6. Just Missed The Train: I very much like this piece.  This song has a very catchy chorus.  The vocal painting does help create much more dramatic pose to this piece.  This song does truly portray Clarkson's vocal abilities. The instrumentation is very nice and creates a nice feel to it, like the intro with the guitar.  The song starts of soft, and then becomes much edgier. <BR>\\\\\"Be quiet angel, don't make a sound ...\\\\\"<BR>5/5<BR>          <BR>7. Beautiful Disaster: this song is something I would classify as something that is more of a teen musically structured song.  This song is good, but does not compare to many other songs on this track.  The instrumentation though is great.<BR>\\\\\"He's as damned as he seems, and more heaven than a heart can hold..\\\\\"<BR>3/5<BR>       <BR>8. You Thought Wrong: this song feature Tamyra Gray, the fourth to last to be eliminated within the AI series.  This song is rocky and devotes much vocal abilities.  In this song, both showcase their talents, competing to reveal the strength of each voice.  Both, Clarkson's and Gray's, vocals compliment each other as they become quite unified during the chorus, and as well as abstract during the verses and add libs. Catchy and great.<BR>\\\\\"You thought we didn't know, you thought we were in the dark...\\\\\"<BR>5/5<BR>           <BR>9. Thankful: is another track that isn't quite catchy on the first listen.  It took a while before I caught onto this song, althoughI must admit that the melody is memorable.  This song has nothing to do with being thankful for being the AI winner, but rather for that someone.  This song is full of soul and showcases the strength in her voice. Okay, but I would prefer other songs over this.<BR>\\\\\" You know my soul, and everything about me there's to know...\\\\\"<BR>3/5<BR>         <BR>10. Anytime: definitely one of the best songs on this track.  It is a nice ballad that isn't too slow.  The instrumentation, the vocal layering, helps create great dramatic pose within this song.  Originally sung by Mary Griffin, Clarkson does a wonderful job by adding her vocal strength and emphasis to creating this piece of her own. Great song. <BR>\\\\\"Anytime you need love, baby I'm on your side...\\\\\"<BR>5/5<BR>          <BR>11. A Moment Like This: this song has started her career.  Although have been released as a single, this piece is surely welcome within \\\\\"Thankful\\\\\".  This supposedly is a New Mix.  The mix is very subtle, even hard to recognize.  The only difference is the extra layering of instruments that help to create a more emotional feeling, although very subtle.  Great track, great singing.<BR>5/5<BR>          <BR>12. Before Your Love: is from Kelly's American Idol released single, the second one I would say.  This is one of my favorite song from Kelly Clarkson.  Again, this is another that was newly mixed.  In this piece, the changes are very subtle once again.  Besides the new layered instrumentation, there is also some different vocals added, like at the very end of the piece where \\\\\"Your\\\\\" is re-edited.  The end, \\\\\"Love\\\\\" is poorly edited as you can hear such dramatic different volumes.  I much recommend the single version over this one.<BR>2/5<br />Almost reaching the 1000 word limit, all I have to say is Buy this platinum CD.  It is great and shows the versatility of a great performer.  Expect more from Kelly Clarkson."	2003-12-15

(Also check out &quot;Soft Rock&quot;, a must-have collection of all of the band's albums, EPs, and singles, with the exception of &quot;Fiestas + Fiascos&quot;.  They are essential companion pieces, as you'll find out in a minute.)  Songwriter Craig Finn's voice will surely appeal to no more than 1% of the general public, and the band's main fans are typically card-carrying members of the very small, very nebulous \\\\\"indie rock\\\\\" scene.  To me, it's the songs that carry the music - and Finn's surgical-strike wordplay, hip-hop-influenced rhyme style, and half-step-behind vocal delivery lifts a large portion of that weight (pardon the pun.)  What Dylan did with \\\\\"Tangled Up In Blue\\\\\" - re-casting each verse's lyrics from different perspectives every time he sang the song - Finn manages to stretch across several albums and singles.  A significant number of Lifter Puller tunes revolve around a private detective story, in which Finn casts himself as the PI who's been double-crossing, double-crossed, and witness to a series of events that seemingly climaxes with the last tune on \\\\\"Fiestas + Fiascos\\\\\".  (Perhaps this makes them the world's first \\\\\"concept\\\\\" band?  If not the first, then certainly the best!)  So, you'll hear about shady characters like \\\\\"Juanita\\\\\" and the \\\\\"Eyepatch Guy\\\\\", and places like \\\\\"15th and Franklin\\\\\" (yep, the intersection in South Minneapolis) in several songs at various times and situations.  There's always enough to leave you guessing.  In fact, the \\\\\"mystery\\\\\" was never really resolved, and may never be.  Finn moved to New York after Lifter Puller disbanded in 2000, and has started a group called The Hold Steady.  The characters from the Lifter Puller albums are not likely, he says, to re-appear in the new band's lyrics.  The standout on \\\\\"Fiestas + Fiascos\\\\\" is the very last tune, \\\\\"The Flex and the Buff Result\\\\\", in which one of themain characters in the \\\\\"mystery\\\\\" is about to buy a nice pair of cement shoes... but the story is far from over."	2003-10-16

Then I read about and listened to samples of this album and decided to buy it. This is my first Helloween album, and I love it! It is a lot darker from their older stuff, but I like that. Against what I think most Helloween fans think I really like Andi Deris' vocal style better than Michael Kiske's because it has so much more power to it. Sure he can't sing as high, but he fits really well on this album. The dark themes of the album are a lot different from the past Helloween material, but the band really sounds good here. The Dark Ride is a great album with a lot of great songs. The Departed has a really cool chorus that I've had stuck in my head for a while. Mirror Mirror is another song that I've been singing for days with its heavy riffs and vocals. Very cool song. If I Could Fly is probably my favorite song here. It's a beautiful song with a chilling piano intro backed up by a heavy yet smooth driving guitar part. Immortal has soaring vocals during the chorus and the title song is for lack of better words excellent. Throughout the album there are awesome guitar riffs and solos, heavy drums, and seriously the best vocals the band could have for this kind of approach. If you don't believe me just imaging Michael Kiske singing on the album. Doesn't quite fit. All in all, I like this album a lot. I think any Helloween fan should have it and any fan of metal as well.	2003-10-14

While the song is a good dance song and has grown on me, I don't feel that this particular song showcased all of JC's talents and abilities. To me the song is filled with screaming and straining, all of which doesn't show us that JC can really sing. I also wasn't all that enthralled with the lyrics, but then again, it's a dance song so it doesn't really matter what is said.<br />Don't get me wrong, play this song at a club or party and I will be out there on the dance floor with the rest of them, but I think that this song was released purely for that purpose - dancing and radio airplay.

I'm not entirely sure I dig this album... one or two tracks were good,  particularly 'Master of the wind'. <BR>Metal warriors and Cherokee are good too, but having 2 new members in the band will ultimately change their sound, and some will probably argue its not REAL Manowar as it is now 1/2 a new group.<BR>The driving bass and screeching vocals are still intact, but the drums and Guitaring have certainly changed.<BR>Only a 1/4 of the guitar solos are actually solos! ....the rest are weird noises churned out by an uncreative (in a sense) axeman... no pun intended. It is also very hard to distinguish if they have either recruited the world's most accurate and precise drummer or just used a drum machine for the studio.<br />Other than that, its a much Darker album.... it dives a little too deep into the black pool than I care for. <BR>Manowar were always about gloom and doom, but the earlier albums had a more uplifting feel to it... (its hard to explain) it was just the chemistry between all 4 original members that gave them the 'feel' that is noticeably absent in this album, perhaps Manowar belong to the 80's more so than the 90's.	2003-01-29

I hope you don't mind if I quote some, so you can get an idea.  Ina May Wool's songwriting is remarkably perceptive about the ways of the heart.  Consider this:<br />\\\\\"Over down in Froze Town, where the ice is real thin<BR>Right move in the wrong direction and the best ones fall in.\\\\\"<BR>(Don't Wanna Wait)<br />Her writing is notable for its economy and power; a word is worth a thousand pictures.<br />\\\\\"Day-old coffee in a cup, and the heat comes clanging up.\\\\\"<BR>(January Thaw)<br />She has her own special way of looking at the world, which involves a generous helping of whimsey.<br />\\\\\"I can be broad as Third Avenue ... I can be small as a molecule.\\\\\"  (Elephant Learning to Dance)<br />The title song for this album, a sleek cabaret number, includes a list of the qualities one might look for in a man; it always makes me smile.<br />Ina May's themes can be dark, but her outlook is anything but.  When she sings about lovers' quarrels (Leopard, January Thaw) it is the glorious making up afterward that interests her.  A song about divorce (J'ai gagne) celebrates one woman's ability to transcend.  The only truly ticked-off song here (The Devil You Don't) becomes a tour de force of wordplay and imagery.  Don't get mad, get eloquent.<BR>The words sound good together too, and the rhymes are tasty.<BR>Combine these excellent lyrics with a variety of interesting melodies, with the artist's sweet, smoky voice, and her engaging performance--the result is something you just have to hear."	2003-01-28

These songs are probably even better-written than the ones on most of his previous albums. Don't buy this album expecting it to be laden with samples, turntables, or random distorted sound effects. In fact, if you're a fan of Beck, it'd probably be a good idea not to EXPECT anything, because if you do, you'll either be perplexed or disappointed on first listen. Just merge with the music and enjoy the way it makes you feel. You see, Beck's music has always challenged conventional song structures and manipulated audio soundscapes, which is still the case, except now Beck is using the sound effects and textures for emotional resonance, which is quite different than the \\\\\"ear candy\\\\\" heard on Odelay. The mood is considerably mellow and very emotional...depressing, but thoughtful. I think Sea Change is just as musically inventive as his others, but the intrumentation is more subtle. There are many musical and emotional climaxes in the songs, which can easily move a person to tears. What do you expect Beck to do when he's depressed, write a goofy bass-heavy club song with turntables and samples?? The honesty of Beck's emotions come through very well in his delivery. His tone is ice-cold on this album. Wonderful for rainy days."	2003-01-26

It is a great testament to the Zawinul/Shorter/Pastorius/Erskine version of WR. This new set of previously unreleased live cuts, recorded between 1975 and 1983 gives a much broader outline of what this band is: the most musical, captivating and amazing group to ever grace the jazz bins. From early versions of 'Black Market' and 'Elegant People' with Alphonso Johnson and Chester Thompson, to a live rendition of 'Teen Town' played shortly after it was recorded on Heavy Weather, to the &quot;best&quot; version of WR (the 8:30 band), to the Bailey/Hakim version with wonderful cuts from Procession, this CD never bogs down or disappoints. It is chock full of beautiful melodies, jaw-dropping solos, and clairvoyant ensemble playing that will be inspiring and thoroughly enjoyable to any WR fan. If you are a musician, you will drink in this offering, and then you'll go practice. An absolute must-have for all fans, and an excellent starting point to the new listener who isn't sure where to start in the WR catalog.	2002-12-28

This is especially true of the last track, &quot;Agnus Dei.&quot;  Or, maybe my problem with that track is that I've listened to Michael W. Smith's original enough I just can't picture it as a Christmas song.<br />Fans of Amy's other two Christmas treasures should give this a little time.  They will warm up to it.

"Sum 41 was unheard of Canadian band(at least as far as America goes), who loved to party and trash hotels. When they released their 2nd LP here in America, instant fame. The usaul don't-[care] lyics and Slayer/Blink 182 (with a touch of melodicness) make this the perfect punk album. You can party to songs (I.E.

I've never been a big fan of hair metal, but only a fool wouldn't recognize Motley Crue as the bad boys of rock in 1980s.  These guys did it all!  Their music was the soundtrack of true decadence, and this incredible hits collection is a sample of their sound: loud, dumb, and fun guitar rock.  Their lyrical range sure doesn't go very far, but who cares?  \\\\\"Dr. Feelgood,\\\\\" \\\\\"Looks That Kill,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\\\\" are such undeniably guilty pleasures that have aged well.  I totally cannot believe I'm writing this, and I'd never thought I'd live to the day I'd actually praise the Crue, but you should get your hands on this collection even if you're a casual listener like myself."	2002-06-26

From beginning to end this album is well musically orchestrated masterpiece. First is the wonderful song &quot;Drive&quot; which is a very cool music number that just grabs you and doesn't let go. Then there's &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot; which is a very wonderful and very musically oriented piece. Then comes &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight&quot; which is a a very good song. Then comes the overused but still well written masterpiece &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; a song about sucide. And has been used in many shows about depression or thoughts of sucide. Then comes a very well written instrumental song &quot;New Orleans Instrumental No. 1.&quot; It makes you wonder why they don't write more instrumentals. They do them so well. Remember &quot;Endgame&quot; from &quot;Out of Time&quot;. Then comes &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; a very good song. Then &quot;Monty gots a Raw Deal&quot; another good song. Then comes &quot;Ignoreland&quot; which is a good song, but the weakest track on this album. Then comes &quot;Star Me Kitten&quot; which is a very good song that has some great vocals by Michael Stipe. Then comes &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; the Andy Kaufman song that just is great. Then comes my favorite song on this album and probably my favorite REM song of all time &quot;Nightswimming&quot; a really beautiful wonderful song even though it is depressing. Then comes &quot;Find the River which is a good song.&quot; If you like REM or if you just like good music you got to get Automatic for the People. You just can't go wrong.

It didn't matter what I thought because I was surprised by the beauty and the great songwriting and production that went into this album. I'm really glad I bought this cd. I listen to it alot and it has a very unique,  yet grunge-ish type sound to it. Rexall is a good song, but I'd have to say that Mourning Son and Hungry are my favorite songs. It's very hard to pick my fave's out of them because they are all very good, at the same level, but unfortuately all kind of have the same sound to them.

This is my absolute favorite recording of &quot;Porgy and Bess.&quot; The orchestrations are just exquisite and I love the tempo. Leontyne Price is my favorite Bess. She gives the right attitude and vocal technique that Bess needs. Another reason why I love this recording is because there are great performances all around. &quot;Summertime&quot; is just marvelous; not soft and operatic with no feeling like many opera singers make it, but real and with real feeling. I have yet to find a better rendition of &quot;My man's gone now.&quot; Again, REAL attitude and I love the personality that the singer brings to it; and the last notes are not mushy, like many singers do with it. The only criticism is with Sportin' Life, he's not a real opera singer. It seemed like they just cast him because of his speaking voice and acting skill. William Warfield, by the way, gives Porgy that delicious huskiness and cut that only a good baritone can give to it. <br />Just a marvelous recording, definitely a keeper!!	2001-12-02

I immediately got the album (had to order it from Amazon because it wasn't easily available elsewhere) and wore the Album's grooves down for a couple of months.<br />Two weeks ago I happened upon their follow-up album here, \\\\\"The Lucky Few,\\\\\" and immediately ordered it. I was apprehensive whether they could followup their great first album with similar work. Rest assured. \\\\\"The Lucky Few\\\\\" is a fabulously assured follow-up which extends Equation's range with a little more guitar driven sound. If you like a great blend of folk-rock, strong female lead vocals and inventively melodic song-writing influenced by tradition English folk songs (updated), you will love this album. You will not regret buying this album. Go for it.<br />By the way, Equation has a great web-site ....  My only regret is that after completion of this album, Seth Lakeman left the group which will change their sound and direction going forward."	2001-11-01

Here they serve the entire meal, starter through to dessert - all of it lip smacking good! Though firmly rooted in the bass-heavy, head-nodding sound of dub, the tracks maintain interest by gently exploring other styles (such as trip hop, break beat, blues, and bossa nova). At the core of each song is strong percussion and around the drumming the other layers of sound are added. The overall effect is a dreamy-stoned sound that will appeal to lovers of the slower stuff from Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, Tosca, Thievery Corporation, Smith &amp; Mighty, et al. It is difficult to pick a favourite track but &quot;Down &amp; out&quot; is wonderfully atmospheric and conjures up images of tumbleweed, rattle snacks and the lonesome life of a cowboy traversing the Arizona desert. Highly recommended.	2001-10-09

With 16 tracks and over an hour of today's best hard music and heavy metal bands including Slipknot, Disturbed, Linkin Park and astounding newcomers such as The Union Underground and Drowning Pool, you can't go wrong. And let's not forget the almighty godfathers of metal, Black Sabbath, performing one of my favorite Sabbath tunes, &quot;The Wizard.&quot;<br />Most tracks on this CD are outstanding, especially &quot;Bodies&quot; by Drowning Pool, &quot;Fear&quot; by Disturbed, and my personal favorite song on this album, &quot;South Texas Deathride&quot; by The Union Underground. The Union keeps the version true to the studio cut while at the same time performing with raw energy that only a live performance can provide. <br />Even if you haven't heard of some of the bands on this CD, if you are a fan of hard music and heavy metal, you can't go wrong buying it. The only thing I can find wrong with this CD (besides the presence of Marilyn Manson) is the fact that the tracks go in order from the end of the show to the beginning of the show...it's strange having the CD opened by the headliners, Black Sabbath, and closed by an opening band, American Head Charge. But, if you can look past that minor point, you'll see quite possibly the best heavy live performance in recent years.	2001-08-15

There is no chorus, there is no hook, MAN! there is no rhythm.<br />Unfortunately the rest of the album goes in the same direction, Aaliyah takes chances on new sounds and beats but they have no where to go.  From her next single &quot;More Than A Woman&quot;....how can I explain this - There is NO song - you need a hook, chorus and rhythm, and it continues with &quot;I Refuse&quot;, etc.  <br />There are no standout singles here, the album is a mish mash mess.  Which is too bad because Aaliyah had a chance with her self titled CD to hit big, but instead it just fizzled.<br />Shows on the Billboard Charts too, where she remains yet to be seen.  Her single &quot;We Need A Resolution&quot; still can't crack the Top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100, maybe because we need hooks, rhythm and chorus.<br />A absolute and total disappointment.	2001-07-19

This is one of the two legendary recordings Stokowski made in1975 (aged 93!) with the obscure indie label Desmar. They've neverbeen available on cd, I guess for [certain] problems (Desmar folded shortly afterwards), and EMI has done a wonderful job in re-issueing them . Nowadays every performance from the past is billed as &quot;legendary&quot; , but this word can be properly used about these two releases. While the other disc is, in my opinion, the definitive recording of the Rachmaninov 3rd  sym., from the conductor who premiered it and  worked closer than any other with the composer, this one is, quite simply, the most amazing rendition of the RVW Fantasia I've ever encountered.  Sometimes mistakenly intended as a &quot;simple&quot; string showpiece, the Fantasia is a most difficult piece, that requires a balance of totale dedication and unerring control, otherwise it can easily sound static, or too syrupy, or too mystic , which was not intended to be (not in the strictly religious sense, at least ). Thankfully there are some great performances around,  like Previn's, Haitink's or Boult's, but I think no one like Stokowski strikes such a perfect blend of concentration, heartfelt dedication and forward momentum. Only Barbirolli matches him, but here the playing is even more refined, and the sound is altogether superior. Stokowski's performance is, at the same time, somber and poignantly passionate , majestic and most finely nuanced. The string &quot;layers&quot; are splendidly balanced, the antiphonal interaction between the two orchestras achieves an unprecedented clarity. No gloss at the expense of depth, though: the hushed beginning is ethereal, while the ecstatic climax is glorious. The Old Magician also extracts the most ravishing sounds from the RPO, that here truly boasts that blend of unity, precision and warmth normally associated with the Concertgebouw or the golden age Philadelphia. This alone is worth the price,  but we also get a most charming, even though idiosyncratic in tempi, performance of the Dvorak, and a real gem, the Stokowski &quot;transfiguration&quot; of the Purcell.  I usually like my ancient music &quot;authentic&quot; but no one like Stokowski ( neither Schonberg nor Respighi or Elgar in their transcriptions)  knew how to make the old masters shine like he did with Bach, and this Purcell transcription is absolutely marvelous. A guilty pleasure, maybe, but who cares, when the music making is so glorious? The Desmar releases were also famous for their sound, and deservedly so. The careful digital remastering has preserved  the splendidly three-dimensional soundstage and, above all,  the uncanny realism of the strings tone rendition. I'm not usually inclined to &quot;analogue nostalgia&quot;, but this is really superior to many chilly DDD recordings. The presentation is overall first class: there's even a picture of the (splendid) original LP covers.	2001-05-09

Before you read this review, you should understand the type that I am. I own every one of his CD releases. My favourite album is Crash, but I do not like songs such as Too Much, and Drive In Drive Out. I also very much admire the dark BTCS, and love Live at Luther College. Listener Supported sucked. I like Dave Matthews when I am able to lose myself in his music, in washes of sound, textured feelings and whispered words. I like Say Goodbye, Two Step, Crush, #40, Pay For What You Get, and others.<br />Now. _Everyday_. What's the deal?<br />My apprehension was confirmed. I listened to I Did It online, like everyone else, and thought &quot;What a lousy song.&quot; They sounded like a guitar rock band. They still do. _Everyday_ is a disappointing, commercial album. Not that DMB weren't commercial, but this album shows a shift towards the -conventional-. They sound like a wussier version of some faceless guitar rock band (Big Wreck, Matchbox 20), with the occasional saxophone squawk. The album feels soft, flat, homogenous. It in no way parallels the dense, Lillywhite production that I adored on BTCS. The finest moments on the disc (Everyday, The Space Between) are during those lilting seconds where the instruments still fill the sounds, fill the emotions, and those individual layers are audible (eg: the chorus on Space Between). I am uninterested in hearing a male vocalist singing good (but not terrific) lyrics, with uninteresting electric guitars and drums. Boyd's violin sounds like the contribution of a session musician who was hanging around. Thanks Rick.<br />Muh. If you've heard I Did It, the album doesn't sound like that. It sounds like a muffled version of that. At one point in Fool To Think (if memory serves), a Hammond organ chimes in. Rather than sounding like a groovy, slidin' and welcome addition (as I feel it does on old Wallflower tunes, for instance - although I do not praise the Wallflowers, usually),it merely sounds boring. It's hardly even notable, recognizable. It contributes -nothing- to the song, adds no heart.<br />Ballard produced Aerosmith? It shows. This is an album without personality, an album that has lost its heart. Some of the songs are -really nice-, but they just sound... off. <br />DMB has a different sound, and the change is a step towards Adult Contemporary, not towards Maturity. Buy it, if you're a fan, but prepare to be disappointed. *sigh* Back to my Gomez albums.	2001-02-09

But now that I do have it, I can confidently say it was SO worth the wait. The feeling may not be mutual among all drum n bass fans, but this album is my ideal representation of perfect dnb. This is rich, beautiful, complex, progressive electronic music, folks - even more so than other Good Lookin stuff. The dense, spaced out harmonies, tinkling stabs of melody, and cool basses are the main factor here - no noisy, minimalistic clanging or irritating Progression Session-type rapping to be found. This is drum n bass as it should be. Even on the wicked Good Lookin label, this is still outstanding.	2001-01-25

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band	Music	5	7	7	N	N	History that lives	I am writing this review out of my personal feelings and beliefs about this album.  I was born in 1963 so did not have a chance to listen to this as it first came out.  However, I did purchase the LP record in 1982 while in college.  Previous to this album, I had only known the Beatles thru greatest hits albums and the Red Album.  Getting this album was new to me in that songs featured on the album were not &quot;super singles&quot;.  Nonetheless I must say that I was significantly enchanted with the weaving of an almost eery indescribably varied emotional feeling one gets when listening to the album.  Each song taken by itself is diminished significantly as a single.  But that is the whole point here.  The music on the album is woven together.  I think of it like a pattern blanket.  Each individual thread of a blanket is not significant, however all of the threads that make the whole blanket, give it meaning, texture and beauty.  The same with SGT PEPPER'S.  The songs when taken as a whole really do take your mind on a deep introspective journey.  They make you think.  Which is what music is supposed to do right?  Try reading the lyrics to each song as they are sung and it really brings each song to life.   Personally, I like some of the lesser songs on the album just as much as the more popular songs.  My favorite is fixing a hole.  The song says something to me.  I believe the song has a certain haunting lonliness to it....She's Leaving Home, ......A Day In the LIfe......Lovely Rita.....When I'm 64....they are all rather lonesome songs.....and yet there is Ringo singing With A Little Help .....which is a pick-me-up to the album.  Whether the intent of the Fab Four or not, the album means to me that we must each look inside and examine ourselves and deal with our lonliness ourselves and sometimes with a LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS....life will be ....GETTING BETTER......WITHIN YOU AND WITHOUT YOU.......i personally feel that George has been bashed too much for the song on the album.  I personally like the meditative qualities and lyrics of his song.   I just purchased the cd yesterday and i still have the LP record from college.  If you have never heard SGT PEPPER then i urge you to get a copy and determine what the songs are saying to you.  I believe each of us a listeners will have different feeling and meanings from the album and that to me is really the beauty of a truly amazing musical work.  BY ALL MEANS THIS IS A FIVE STAR ALBUM AND A HISTORIC LANDMARK IN MUSIC HISTORY. LISTEN  YOURSELF AND BE A PART OF IT!	2000-11-19

Self is the brain-child of  Matt Mahaffrey. On Gizmodgery he takes you on a sugary pop ride with abrasive noises scattered among the landscape like road signs along a stretch of American highway. Instead of just providing entertaining distractions the noises become seamless parts of the scenery. A feature that makes Self's fifth album unique is the fact that every note produced on the album was made with a toy instrument. Little Tikes Xylophone, Mattel See &amp; Say, Schoenhut Toy Piano, and Groovy Tunes Guitar are just a few of the toys used. No \\\\\"real\\\\\" instruments were used. Little diatribes into children rhymes and pop culture references keeps this album from becoming a monotonous, gimmick album. That and the toy instruments sound great, especially on a cover of The Doobie Brother's hit, What A Fool Believes. Not that the idea is completely original, Pianosaurus released their album Groovy Neighborhood in 1987, with all tracks played on children's instruments that were purchased at toy stores.<br /> Is this the best album I've heard all year? No. But it is fun and when you realize that it wasn't made with instruments that cost thousands of dollars, it's a reaffirmation for all those bedroom producers out there."	2000-11-11

This album, yet again another collaboration with David Bowie is also a sneak peek to Bowie's next album Never Let Me Down. Both are undoubtedly the same style of music, written the same way, and put together in a  similar fashion. However, I believe Blah Blah Blah is a much better album  then Never Let Me Down. Bowie seemed rushed on Never Let Me Down. On Blah  Blah Blah, Bowie and Pop seemed to be relaxed and there's no tension in the  air. I believe Bowie would have muched rather preferred put effort and time  into Blah Blah Blah, but with his binds to the contract with EMI, he had to  move on. Blah Blah Blah seems like an album Iggy Pop would be terrible at  writing and performing. Wrong! Iggy seems to fit in on this album more than  on any of his previous albums! He seems straightforward, something we  didn't always see from Iggy in the early days with The Stooges. And this  new found sense of directness really helps out on songs like  &quot;Shades&quot;, &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Isolation&quot;, and  &quot;Cry For Love&quot;.	2000-07-08

If you dig the Windham Hill crowd, you'll love this CD (seriously-- Windham Hill fans should buy it right now).  However, if, like me, you STRONGLY prefer John Fahey's  american-primative sound to Ackerman's new age sound, steer clear of this  one.  In jazz terms, if you love Wes Montgomery and can't stand Pat  Metheny, you probably won't be as enthusiastic about this disc as other  reviewers.<br />There is a frightening tendency among music (particularly  guitar) fans to praise anyone who shows technical proficiency, which Tuck  certainly does.  However, I find most of Tuck's music a bit academic and  antiseptic.  This album has a few true high points.  \\\\\"Manonosh\\\\\" and \\\\\"Louie  Louie\\\\\" show that when Tuck really wants to, he can keep up with the best.   I also found his rendition of Bonfa's classic, \\\\\"Manha de Carnival\\\\\" a  somewhat refreshing new take on the track (although I prefer Sandy Bull's  more elaborate interpretation on the highly recommended \\\\\"Re-Inventions\\\\\").   However, I am not as impressed by Tuck's pop stuff.  When Coltrane covered  \\\\\"My Favorite Things,\\\\\" it was a revelation.  When Andress covered \\\\\"Somewhere  Over the Rainbow,\\\\\" it sounded cheesy.  Most disappointing was Andress'  attempted opus, \\\\\"Grooves of Joy,\\\\\" which ended up sounding like a bunch of  disparate pieces of varied styles spliced together without any transition  or sense of overall composition, although individually, the parts were  interesting, which was why I found it so disappointing.  For a finger style  jazz artist capable of pulling something like that off, I would suggest  Adrian Legg (particularly \\\\\"Guitars and Other Cathedrals,\\\\\" on which the  title track actually does pull together somewhat disparate strands into a  tight composition, but be ware, Legg also plays a lot of bluegrass-type  stuff that may not be to everyone's liking.  Also, check out Preston Reed).   Finally, if you are really interested in a mind-blowing technique  combiningmelody and bass lines played at the same time, check out Charlie  Hunter, who plays an 8-string guitar (3 bass strings, 5 guitar strings)  allowing him to play bass lines and melody at the same time, and even mimic  a Hammond almost flawlessly."	2000-06-19

I do love to listen to this at least once  every week, if not every day. Their lyrics would be as poetic as some of  those professional poets, and the words actually mean something. They are  great musicians, with lots of talent. Following the tradition of true  hardcore, they are close to their fans and keep in touch, helping build a  huge following. Daryl's singing/screaming is meaningful, and it is a great  way of expressing their anger, hear me Marylin Manson and Fred Durst?

Fleming proves herself worthly of being noted as THE Strauss soprano of today.  The  lyrical creaminess of her exceptional soprano, along with her marvleous  acting ability and great sensitivity to Strass' women protagonists and  their psychological underpinings, makes her ideal in this repertoire.  She  is without a doubt the best exponent of this repertoire since Kiri ti  Kanawa, (whom I had the opportunity to see in the PBS telecast of Der  Rosenkavelier). However, Fleming's sharp interpretative skills far surpass  Te Kanawa's, (who was more the singer than the actress).<br />    In this CD,  Fleming is also fortunate to have two experienced Strauss singers,  mezzo-soprano, Susan Graham and soprano, Barbara Bonney teamed with her.  Each with equally good presence and  complete understanding of their  characters.  Graham sings an alluring and passionate Octavian with a  gloriously rich mezzo, and Bonney sings a particularly sweet Sophie and an  endearing Zdenka. Hearing these outstanding three performing so well  together, one's appetite is wetted to hear them perform these  Strauss  masterpieces in their entireties--particularly Der Rosenkavelier.<br />     Highlights for me on this magnigicent disc were the final trio of Der  Rosenkavelier,(the gem of the entire recording)and the closing scene of  Capriccio.  The hauntingly beautiful final trio is representative of three  outstanding passionate artists who love their music and who are giving it  all through the heart.  This concept is also significant in the Cappricco  performance.  In the booklet of the CD, Fleming remarked that this was her  favorite piece on the CD; and you can tell this very plainly by hearing her  completely passionate performance as the Countess--a role she has not yet  sung on stage, and a role in which she will most certainly triumph in in  the near future.  This is a truly remarkable recording.	2000-05-07

Blues and folk music, yes. Maybe even real rock and roll. But hardcore?  Not a chance.  That is, until bands like Haste come along and attempt to  put lonely places like Hueytown, Alabama on the map. Haste are not your  run-of-the-mill hardcore band and being from the south it is not much  wonder why. The scene has no rich history or modern presence as its  north-eastern or west coast counterparts.  What it has is young ambitious  bands, filled with enough angst, emotion and musical ideas to pack a  convincingly brutal punch. The unconventional dual lead vocal approach  immediatly sets them appart from the pack.  Two distinctly different  screams are offset by the duets pairing of clean voices thus allowing for  layering or call-and-response interplay between the four approaches.   Even  musically, Haste attempts to crack the mold with it's gritty dual guitar  approach and southern-fried grooves.  The interplay between vocalists and  slamming breakdowns are fully exploited on \\\\\"the Absentee\\\\\" and \\\\\"a Chance for  You to Prove\\\\\" and will even leave a sizable impact after \\\\\"Irriatation  Persists.\\\\\"  If the future of Haste lies in the direction of those songs,  expect a brutal and aurally pummeling sophmore effort. Their debut release  on Century Media presents itself, at times, as if a glorified demo and is  truly a hardcore recording reminisant of the DIY era of underproduced  basement tapes.<br />However, the potential for something greater shines forth  in the overall product and leaves the door open for Haste to devolope their  sound throughout their career. Just as the title implies, Haste persue  their own sound and musical direction in the face of mainstream music and  conventional hardcore thinking and the only concequesce to the endevour is  that more people have not yet been exposed to what they have to offer."	2000-05-01

Not surprisingly, the material not written my Dave  Mustaine seems to have more musical aspects (Phantom Lord, Motorbreath,  Seek &amp; Destroy).

I think that I could come up with better songs than the ones they used. I it really  wouldn't kill them to make at least one song about something besides love.  I don't buy it. Mandy is 15 and really spacey and I just don't believe she  is feeling the emotions that are in her lyrics. I real performer has to  feel the music and understand it but Mandy just sort of struggles to hit  the notes and is more worried about her cameos on MTV. I find it ironic  that this CD is called &quot;So Real&quot; cause it is anything but.	2000-03-14
US	50032287	R1MTEYC2B4187Q	B000006OPR	697541984	Cruelty & Beast	Music	1	9	22	N	N	You're kidding me... right?	Cruelty And The Beast, like all the other CDs within this genre, is unadulterated trash.<br />First of all, even those who proclaim their undying devotion for Cradle Of Filth, admit that Danni's vocals take a while to get  used to.  Perhaps it needs to be explained to these misguided individuals,  that music should not be something that you struggle to get used to.<br />For those of you who have never had the displeasure of listening to  Danni sing, suffice it to say, it sounds similar, I imagine, to what it  must sound like, to hear an elderly female elf being savagely  beaten.<br />Luckily, the rest of the band is so devoid of talent, that you  will find it difficult to focus on Danni's vocal for any length of time.<br />The one saving grace of this offering is Danni's comedic lyrical style.  Never before have I had the opportunity to read a lyric sheet that made me  laugh out loud.  The way he carelessly throws around words and phrases,  that he clearly doesn't understand, never ceases to be absolutely  hysterical.  I did however find it hard to decipher, which was funnier;  Danni's lyrics, or his fan's belief that they are somehow poetic.<br />I was  deeply saddened by the one reviewer who drew comparisons between this  Cradle of Filth offering, and Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime.  It must  be a horrible thing to be born without ears.<br />I would, however, recommend  this CD, to any and all 12 year olds, who really want to upset their  parents.  Although, since disenfranchised boys, age 10-12, make up COF's  core audience, I am sure they already own this CD.	2000-02-18

Steve March Torme's 'Swingin' at the Blue Moon Bar and Grille' does just that, it swings!  From the title cut, all the way through to the final 'A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square' Steve's vocals will captivate any  listener all the way through this fine piece of work. One favorite is  'Straighten Up And Fly Right', the duet with his dad rates right up there.  Something about hearing the elder and the younger Torme' together is sweet,  as Steve proves he can skat with the best of them. There's a pleasing mix  of both uptempo numbers and ballads on this CD,which are sung with  style,and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for some  real good music.	2000-02-02

There are no words that will adequately convey the tremendous powerful,  gentleness of her voice.  Tara is extremely gratious to her audience, and performs in a way, that is intimate and invites the listener  into her heart and soul.  Of course at the end of the show, I purchased her  EP &quot;If You See Me&quot; and before leaving Austin, had to stop at a  local record shop and purchase her previously released album.  My body,  heart, and soul were encapsulated by the passion and emotion that she pours  into each of her songs (both vocally and lyrically). <br />Tara's music is the  kind of music that will bring chills, tears, joy, and hope to the lives of  everyone that ''listens'' to her passionate delivery of her gift.   <br />Embrace this music, and you will realize all of this and  more.	2000-01-24

Certainly some  of the results are a little ungainly, but Act 2 contains some of the most  thrilling singing I have heard from this singer - the grand arching phrases  in her Act 2 aria are epic - and the ensuing duet with Pavarotti  really  generates excitement. Act 3 is less succesful 'Morro ma prima in grazia'  suffers from problems with register breaks, and the magical final farewell  of the lovers, accompanied by Verdi's bitter-sweet stage waltz is spoiled  by Abbado pressing ahead too much; both singers have to gulp to keep up.  The supporting cast is very strong, Obratsova stentorian and Cappuccilli  very involved. The conducting too is fiery, as you'd expect. Not a prime  recommendation for 'Ballo' obviously, but worth hearing Verrett and big  Lucy in full flood in act 2.	2000-01-20

I bought &quot;UHF: The Soundtrack&quot;, without pre-listening or recommendation, and I sort of liked it.  But there is one big problem: too many fillers.  I don't like fillers because that shows an artist's lack of  any thing better to do than to  rack out something that lasts about a  minute.  Take &quot;Let Me Be Your Hog&quot; for example.  It lasts a mere  17 seconds long!  &quot;Spatula City&quot; and &quot;Fun Zone&quot; were  also tasteless.  The only filler I was able to enjoy was &quot;Ganhdi  II&quot;.  I like Al's pacifist-to-Rambo twist.  It's creative.  Even  though there are a lot of fillers, &quot;UHF: The Soundtrack&quot; does  entertain.  Songs like &quot;Money for Nothing: Beverly Hillbillies&quot;,  &quot;Spam&quot;, &quot;The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota&quot;,  &quot;She Drives like Crazy&quot;, and, the epitamy of UHF, &quot;Isle  Thing&quot;.  Mediocrety is apletnty in &quot;The Hot Rocks Polka&quot;,  &quot;Attack of the Radioative Hamsters from a Planet Near Mars&quot;, and  &quot;UHF&quot;, but &quot;Generic Blues&quot; fails to deliver.<br />Just the  same, &quot;UHF: The Soundtrack&quot; is a pretty enjoyable  &quot;Al&quot;-bum.	2000-01-02

This time, instead of folk, Beck has co-opted the funk to suit his own layered musical style.  And while a lot of the music is tongue in  cheek about the whole cliche-ridden business that is R&amp;B, he always  keeps it so you know he's also respecting the true artists of the form  (Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Prince).  It's a treasure in today's barren  musical landscape.	1999-12-01

I believe this to be silvestri's best work since his Back to The future Series . You can really  always tell a good soundtrack, by its ability to be heard over and over  again and to still move you in new ways.

I found myself getting bored with  this album somewhere during &quot;Here is the House&quot;.  In fact, the  only song I really care for after &quot;Question of Time&quot; is the  aforementioned &quot;But Not Tonight&quot;.  &quot;Question of Time&quot;  was easily my favorite after the first listen, but it quickly grew old and  I've come to like &quot;But Not Tonight&quot; and especially &quot;Question  of Lust&quot; (a song which proves that Martin Gore should sing lead vocal  in more DM songs), the best. <br />This was definitely the turning point for  Depeche Mode, but it was a turn that, barring Violator, didn't produce much  more than a few extremely dark but average albums.	1999-08-31

Great bass in this one! Burrell's phrasing is always tasteful, and the sax  sound is something! Some may miss a piano (there's not a single keyboard  note in the whole album) and I wouldn't mind if they had used trumpet a la  Miles Davis in some places, but the guitar-sax interplay is creative  enough.<br />This is a fine album that you can listen from beginning to end  and just have a good time!	1999-06-28

I popped the CD into my laptop and it all did everything else on its own. It automatically set up the wireless networking between the two. I Have printed several study guides and packets for school work so far and no jams, prints nicely. I LOVE the wireless printing feature!! The unit itself is very sleek, modern, and nice looking. The display screen is nice looking and easy to use.<br />I have also set up my phone and kindle to print directly from them with the wireless printing!<br />  It scans and copies with a breeze. I looked up the ink cost for when it needs to be replaced and the ink replacement prices aren't that bad, I primarily use only black in. My only complaint is it could be a little quieter. Overall for a printer that can do everything but fax you could not go wrong with this purchase.<br />Some of the bad reviews seem to be mainly from not properly installing the ink and not properly doing the alignment or just a defective printer which lets face it happens with most products at one point or another,	2015-07-07

The silver and gold were very important to me as I used gold and silver leaf and I hoped to replace the set because I have broken the hinges and watercolor has become a lot more important to me of late.  I can't speak to the quality of the new sets because the first one came without gold and silver and so did the second. I am returning both.  The colors are misrepresented in the photo on amazon.  I don't really like the new box configuration.  As others have said, it's too bulky.  I tried to find replacement pans and have been unable to locate a source.  I contacted Pelikan and have had no response.  My conclusion is that they have decided to focus on the K12 market and forget about artists and professionals, so I bought a Talens set.  The box is metal, compact, and should withstand being carried around.  It has my gold and silver and yes, it cost more, but I know I'll be happier with it.	2014-10-22

Clearing a jam is also a pain, and I've bleed a few times trying to do so. Further, this stapler is weighted poorly, and takes effort to use, because of its awkward size.<br /><br />Cutting to the chase, spend a little more on a stapler if you want to use one, otherwise, go with binder clips.

It works great, and as long as you treat it kindly, it should last for years. Prior to this, I'd had two shredders die on me within a couple of months.<br />Keeping it lubricated with the shredder oil is a must, and although it says it takes 11 sheets, I am a bit more conservative and only do about 5 at a time. Definitely suitable and durable enough for home use.	2014-01-19

After May 2014<br />you will  have to buy a VOIP service.<br />The following quote is from [...]<br />Google Sets the Date for the End of XMPP with Google Voice<br />Recently Google announced the end of support for XMPP based calling with Google Voice. This will happen on May 15, 2014 – that’s over 6 months from today. Since your OBi device uses XMPP to communicate with Google servers, the end of support will directly impact how your OBi device can be used with your Gmail account and its associated Google Voice phone number. Unfortunately, you will no longer be able to use the Google Voice communication service to make calls using the phone connected to your OBi device.  Also, the ability to receive calls to your Google Voice number, directly from Google’s service, will not be possible.	2014-01-08

"I've been using Project Life -- and buying at least 3 kits each year -- since the very first year, and as a beach-fanatic, I was so excited to hear there was going to be a \\\\\"seafoam\\\\\" kit. When I saw this kit, though, I was sorely disappointed. Only one color in the kit -- the aqua -- fits the theme. The remaining cards/materials are black, mustard, gray, and orange -- far from the colors associated with \\\\\"seafoam\\\\\" or a beachy or ocean theme.

Large buttons, but not huge. Speaker phone works nicely, no hissing or interference. I would have given this phone 5 stars except for one thing 1. The handset could be a little larger. When trying to cradle it between your cheek and shoulder as we all do, it wants to flop over sideways. But I look at this as a minor aspects to what generally is an excellent phone, and I would recommend it and I would repurchase it if needed.	2013-01-19

It was a huge hassle trying to get a refund on this item from Target.<br /><br />I bought this product and it worked perfectly.

[[ASIN:B0016L24EC Cardinal Zippered Binder Pockets, 8.5 x 11 Inches, Clear, 3 per Pack (14201)]] These binder pockets I purchased from Amazon were a great solution for a small business owner who hates bookkeeping as well as keeping track of all the little papers in pocket folders. He can now accumulate the daily receipts and records in a pocket at the end of each shift, zip the pocket up, write the date on the outside with a marker, and drop it off to me (the bookkeeper). No more lost records. They save me a lot of time sorting papers by date, as well. The marker can later be erased with alcohol. I put the zipper pockets in a Case-It D-185 extra large capacity zipper binder so he can keep the records all together and easily transport them to me. The only minor flaw is that the zipper pockets are as wide as the binder, but they are flexible so it isn't a big deal. The price, which resolved to $1.75 per pocket seemed a little high to me, but I decided to overlook that because this product offered the optimal solution, and the material seems durable and of good quality.	2012-07-06

May come in: Red / Black / Silver / Green / Purple / Blue	Office Products	1	9	11	N	N	Fast, Cheap...and...cheap.	I'm a math teacher.  I thought I could help my kids understand trigonometry by using laser pointers and protractors to measure some distances from objects.  I bought 3 sets (18 pointers) and paid for overnight shipping.  The shipping was fast, I did get 18, and they have different colors (as advertised).  They come with a plastic disc keeping the battery from discharging (reasonable), and tell you to remove it before using.  Fine.  But as I removed them, I discover which ones work and which don't. I've now opened 6, two work as expected, the other four have various problems.<br />  #3 , when pressing the button to toggle between blue and white light works inconsistently...sometimes it is white, then blue, then white, then off.  Other times it is white then blue then off.  Sometimes the blue flashes.<br />  #4, the white and blue sort of work, but the laser pointer (Red) is totally non functional.<br />  #5, the white and blue are just DOA (non functioning), but the laser works fine.<br />  #6, when I took the disk out to give the battery contact, the entire device fell apart...buttons fell out of the holes, electronic assembly slipped out the end of the tube.  I tried, but I can't easily get the buttons back in....which means the assembly has no way to turn on.  I'll try some more...but so far, these are just pieces of junk!  I'm hoping, that by spending more than forty five dollars (for three sets and overnight shipping) that I'll have 6 to work with.  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  I should have gone to CVS and picked up 10 for that price.  I was totally taken in by the reviews.	2012-03-14

I enjoy the fact that I don't have the clutter or hassle of nearly 80 CD's which was the only previous way to enjoy listening the Word of Promise.  Now all of the great audio from Caviezel and all of the excellent narrators fits in my pocket and goes with me everywhere.  I too read the review regarding text errors in The Word of Promise NowBible, so I contacted the publisher.  They shared that the following 3 MINOR text errors are present in the original version:  1) Ephesians 4:26 incorrectly contains the word \\\\\"not\\\\\" in front of angry.  2) Galatians 3:15 contains a question mark in the word \\\\\"covenant.\\\\\"  3) Matthew 12:32 misspells \\\\\"it\\\\\" as \\\\\"bit will be forgiven him....\\\\\"  It turns out that both the Ephesians and Matthew errors were actually present in the original Text files from Thomas Nelson, the publisher of the NKJV Word of Promise.  The question mark error in Galatians was a matter of file conversion in the programming process, and was a slight error on the part of the NowBible engineers.  I have been assured that a software update will be made available by 3/1/12 on the NowBible website and that the original text files are being corrected by Nelson.  In fact, these issues are so minor that I likely won't even bother updating since there is no other reason to.  If you love listening to and studying the Word on the go, you will love this product."	2012-02-02

They are clearly superior to the standard paper CD or CD/DVD labels in that they're constructed of a thin film, but the top side is still paper-like and printable.  The package suggests using a CD jewel case as an applicator, which seems to be what they were designed for.  When using a \\\\\"stomper\\\\\" type labeler instead, the hub does seem a bit snug, but still usable.  I got a couple of bubbles on one or two, but they were relatively easy to push out to the edge or to the hub with a credit card.    Overall, I like the product, but I do have a couple of suggestions:  First, the current price really seems higher than it should be.  While these are good quality labels that are likely made using more expensive materials and processes, I'm sure they couldn't cost nearly this much to produce.  Second, I wish someone would make Blu-Ray labels that cover the whole disk up to the hub, not just to where a CD's hub would be.  I'd happily pay this price for those.  The BD-R disks I bought actually have a brand logo that extends closer to the hub than these labels cover, which makes the finished product look much less professional.    Update: The price has gone down somewhat in the meantime, so it's a little more reasonable now.  These are still about the best I've found for DVDs, and Avery still doesn't seem to make a Blu-ray version so these will do in a pinch for that too, though not ideal."	2012-01-22

Just replace your CMY cartridges and you're set!	Great price for a 5-in-1 wireless printer. However..  I've had this printer for well over 6 months now, and I've already replaced cartridges thrice already. Not bad, you would say, but 3 ink cartridges for using it at the most twice every month? I swear, it's like this printer comes with tiny elves whose only purpose is to dry the ink cartridges up as soon as midnight strikes.   Plus, it won't let you print when ANY one of the cartridges are low. How the hell should yellow ink matter when I'm printing in b&w? Besides, I just changed the yellow cartridge last week, and haven't printed anything until now, which -- to stress -- shouldn't require yellow since I'm printing in b&w! Even a colorblind kid in kindergarten who failed art class would see the inanity of the situation.   So THAT'S why the price for this 5-in-1 wireless printer isn't that steep: Brother earns via the cartridges. Here's the math: Cartridges dry up easily + can't print when one is low = buy new cartridges. Suddenly, it's not great anymore.   This printer and it's cartridges are a scam.

Around 2001, I worked with a gel-filtered $31,000 full color system that autofed and scanned about 10 PPM at 300 DPI and was about the size of a large floor-standing copy machine.  Then of course there are fully-optical greyscale PAO scan systems that have been used in exceptionally expensive high speed copiers for some time as well.  Needless to say, this one for under $500 caught my attention.<br /><br />========<br />Setup...<br />========<br /><br />Setup was unfortunately slightly more painful than it should be.  The dead-tree version was pictorial \\\\\"Step 1: Take it out of the box.  Step 2: DO NOT PLUG IT IN.  Step 3: Run our program.\\\\\"  Right.  Onto the program then...<br /><br />Everybody knows that on a good day, one should read ALL of the instructions first to have a good overview, then follow the instructions in order thereafter.  This is not an option given in this.  The installation went to a setup assistance wizard that walks the user through one page at a time, one tiny button press at a time, but skimps on exceptionally important details.  A full page of directions to tell you to press \\\\\"OK\\\\\" after selecting the language, but \\\\\"remove all packaging material\\\\\" being the only item on that page.  Tape, protective plastic, and various other protective items to keep the printer safe in transit...  30 minutes hunting for it all and a number of steps later we found even more.<br /><br />The program is also not able to handle cases where the printer is on a different WiFi network segment than the computer, for example if the computer is on a 5GHz N network and the printer is on the 2.4 on the same router.  It really wants to try WiFi Protected Setup in that case, but it fails miserably because the radio frequency is wrong.  Turns out this mandates a forced termination of the setup program on the computer and manual configuration of the printer.  The touch-screen is very nice to use, except when typing on it.  People who are used to responsive resources like cell phones will have to slow down for this.<br /><br />The touch screen itself is actually a nice feature though.  Light-up touch buttons are hidden in the darkness below the screen, only lighting up buttons that apply when they do apply.  This is a nice way to prevent the accidental pressing of buttons that do absolutely nothing in a given context, but can also create a touch of frustration if the button you feel you need is not present at thee time.  The touch screen can have effectively applets added to the printer, but most of these are less than useful for what the average person does.  Sure you -can- print photos directly off an SD card and touch them up on the screen, or print from iOS devices, but the actual functionality of these features are limited. Mobile printing does not cover Android, but some research shows this to bee a limitation in the android OS itself.<br /><br />==========<br />Printer...<br />==========<br />There will be minimal printing data in this review, so I'll address that here.<br /><br />There are four printers in this room and the printer on the Lexmark is about the same quality and speed.  The things to consider with the printer:  It's loud.  I mean LOUD.  It scared our cat it's that loud.  A test at the store confirms that this is apparently normal.  There is no secondary paper feed, only a single top-load tray that is difficult to reach behind the main bulk of the system.  Beyond that, printing is perfectly par for the task.  It will print at an average speed (by ISO standards), with an average quality.  As is always the case, when time passes, top-load printers are more susceptible to dust on the pick up roller causing misfeeds.<br /><br />==========<br />Scanner...<br />==========<br />I feel like holding this device up above my head and making a chime like \\\\\"You just found something awesome in a video game!\\\\\".  I'm going to save the best for last here, so we'll start with Considerations.<br /><br />Firstly, it is limited to 300 DPI.  That being said, if you are scanning in color, the average printer prints at 300 or 360 LPI maximum, and usually prints at 150 LPI.  There is a substantial difference between printer DPI and PPI/LPI.  DPI in a printer is how many dots it can make, but each dot is simply a part of the grid that makes up the \\\\\"pixel\\\\\" (used in PPI).  The DPI of a printer only matters as much in Black and White, and even then is limited by the paper quality.  You have to take the DPI and divide it by the number of dots in the grid for each pixel to get the PPI/LPI of the printer, which defines how many pixels of incoming data are printed per inch.  Shockingly, the super-high-DPI Epson printers print 5x5 grids in their pixels, so are actually 288 LPI.  When you account for nearest-neighbor reduction and interpolation, as well as scan-bar physical limitations, 300 DPI is sufficient or even optimal in the vast majority of cases.<br /><br />The above is a verbose way of saying \\\\\"Unless you know for a fact that you need more than 300 DPI, and know WHY you need more than 300 DPI (eg, know what LPI, PPI, lp/in, DPI, Plaid and Moire are), 300 DPI scanning is better than higher DPI in most cases.\\\\\" Then that is just saying \\\\\"Don't listen to numbers.  Bigger is not always better, and the numbers don't mean what they want you to think they mean anyway.  This scanner is perfect for what you are probably going to do with it.\\\\\"<br /><br />The next consideration is that it is a near-vertical scanning surface.  The placement of things in the middle of the scanner glass or of papers that are wrinkled or bent requires some finagling.  Scanning non-flat objects is right out without a lot of effort.<br /><br />The final consideration is that there is no automatic paper feed.  If the idea was to scan things Really, Really Fast by dropping a stack of papers on and running to grab a cup of coffee, this will not support that.  At the same time, the super-speed scanning will allow you to swap out papers manually and still achieve a speed in great excess of the capabilities of any automatic feed.<br /><br />But on to the exciting part of the scanning!<br /><br />Firsta quick primer in how your average light-bar scanner works:  The light needs to be \\\\\"warmed up\\\\\", because any change in light levels will cause color differences.  Then it moves this light source across the paper and focuses one line of data onto a line of greyscale sensors that detect how much light is bouncing off the paper.  \\\\\"But if it's greyscale sensors, how does it scan in color?\\\\\"  The color portion is achieved by putting that line of light through a prism that splits it into all the colors of the rainbow.  The prism is tilted rapidly as it scans across the paper, causing the red, green, and blue portions of the light to fall on the sensor.  The levels of red, green, and blue determine the actual \\\\\"color\\\\\" of the stuff being scanned.<br /><br />Got all that?  Don't worry, you don't need to.  The thing to take away from that is that the way that light works means that the split between red, green, and blue, will come from SLIGHTLY different parts of the paper.  What does this mean?  It means that high contrast changes in color will end up with chromatic aberration.  That's a fancy way of saying that the colors at the edges of things will bee wrong.  If you scan a black and white thing in color, then magnify the results, you will be able to see the slight colored \\\\\"shadows\\\\\" at the edges.  The downside is that this effect occurs on the whole scan, changing the colors of everything by just a fraction.<br /><br />The Lexmark Genesis S800 series uses a single-capture system, like your digital camera.  It splits the colors by illuminating the scanned surface with the three different colors in order, two flashes each from Red, Green, and Blue LED light sources respectively.  While I could get into more detail about the technology, I won't. What I will say is that this gives the much-coveted \\\\\"Scanner with No Chromatic Aberration At All\\\\\" title.  Zero.  Zilch.  Something that would have cost me as much as a car back a decade ago, now sitting on my desk.<br /><br />That also means that scans are taken in under a second, and the \\\\\"Three second scan speed\\\\\" is a result of the data transfer to the computer.  Scan color is also excellent, and the LED light source has an expected life span substantially  greater than the cold cathode light source in a normal scanner. Plus the color of the light source will not change as time passes.<br /><br />==========<br />Copying...<br />==========<br />Nothing good or bad to say here.  On-par printing, excellent scanning, makes for an on-par copier.  Speed is decent and the large touch screen helps you get exactly what you expect.  The enhanced scan speed allows you to preview substantially faster, however does not improve the end copy speed since other All-in-Ones start the printing as soon as they have enough data to do so, and the rest of the scanning can progress while the printing occurs.<br /><br />=========<br />Faxing...<br />=========<br />As we have no physical phone line to this location, I cannot justify performing a personal review on the faxing capabilities.  I can point out that the device will wake out of sleep mode if thee line rings, even when set not to receive automatically.  This is intentional, as it allows you to decide to manually receive a fax with the device, a function you would not be able to perform if it was fully asleep.<br /><br />==========<br />Summary...<br />==========<br /><br />If you are looking for a GOOD all-in-one machine, the Lexmark Genesis S815 will definitely meet your needs with a good price point at the time of this review and a lot of features that put it ahead of the pack in little ways.<br /><br />If you are looking for a REVOLUTIONARY scanning solution, especially if you want to wipe chromatic aberration off the list of problems with scanning, look no further.  I would love to see Lexmark take the scanning system on this and run with it in the future.  Features like auto-feed scanning, a flat scanning bed, higher DPI (though 600 DPI would require a 34 Megapixel sensor... *twitch*), or even a standalone scanner would round this out from an outstanding scanning solution to become the best thing since sliced bread.<br /><br />Based on the massive price dive this took in recent times, price guarantees may be in your benefit. At the same time, if the price dive is a fire sale, let's hope that more good stuff like this comes out soon!<br /><br />=============<br />PostScript...<br />=============<br />As the device gets more use here, and if people request it, as always I will update my reviews.  Let Amazon and I know if the review was helpful and comment if you have specific questions or observations you'd like to make.  I am alerted to comments and will follow up as soon as possible.<br /><br />===================<br />Oct 8th 2011 Update<br />===================<br />After some time using this now, the honeymoon has worn off.  Since Lexmark made efforts to correct the problem, had the correction been effective, this update would not have been written.  The sordid details are unfortunately disturbing.<br /><br />The first item is more of note to people who purchase this for printing.<br />After about a week, the printer exhibited the issues with ink clogs that were mentioned in other reviews, primarily with black ink.  The old case of \\\\\"Print something... ANYTHING... once a week to help prevent this\\\\\" was a non-starter in this matter, as it would even clog literally in the middle of a printed page.  The amount of cleaning to finally unclog it was a major consumption of ink.  Of course, since we purchased it primarily for scanning, we were not too concerned.  A person who purchases it to print, however, may want to take the hint from now two reviews that it may not be the best idea.<br /><br />Then the scanner started having brightness issues.  The center of a scanned page was at first minimally, then increasingly brighter than the edges.  Since our main use of the printer is artwork and full color items, this impact was starting to cause a serious problem, finally to the point where the scan of a white sheet of paper ended up yellow at the edges and corners (implying an increasing failure in the blue LED illumination).<br /><br />A call to support had them investigating via remote access and easily seeing the scanner problem.  An RMA (warranty replacement) was issued and a new unit was cross-shipped.  A cross-ship is a very good thing as it means the new unit arrives, then the old one is sent back in the same packaging, pre-paid by Lexmark.  As I said, had this corrective measure been effective, this review would not have received an update right now, and in the future an update on ink issues should they have resumed with the new unit.<br /><br />Unfortunately the new unit arrived \\\\\"Mostly working\\\\\".  Mostly is fine and all when it's a non-critical non-operational portion, however this case of not-working is actually the top section of the touch screen, which needs to operate to even begin to set up the unit on initial use.  This effectively makes the unit Dead On Arrival and completely unusable.  In 3-5 more business days from now and no working device for the continuing duration, we shall try Number Three.<br /><br />This double-failure has decreased my confidence in Lexmark's ability to have this product work consistently and correctly in general and resulted in the related rating decrease.  More information pending in the future.<br /><br />=====================<br />Feb 25th, 2012 Update<br />=====================<br /><br />Thank you to John, in the comments, for reminding me to update this.<br /><br />Despite originally being told by the service representative that there was nothing they could do, Lexmark Customer Service took care of things very well.  The call to Lexmark regarding the DOA replacement was made on October 8th.  The second replacement unit arrived on October 9th at 9 am with Next Day AM Priority shipping.  It was functional in all manners and resolved the primary complaints.<br /><br />That being said, Lexmark should have designed and marketed this as a scanner, not an All-in-One.  The printing is So-So when it works.  As countless other reviews have indicated, \\\\\"When it works\\\\\" is not a good thing to count on.<br /><br />The scanning functionality is still tremendously useful and gets very regular use, however its primary user, my wife, refuses to even consider using the printer portion any longer.  Numerous head clogs chewed through ink for cleaning, it continued to fail in the middle of printing pages, and finally decided to exhibit \\\\\"out of ink\\\\\" printing behavior despite the fact that the printer thought it had 25% black left.  She has forbidden me from examining the cartridge because she is so ecstatic with the scanner, she doesn't want any chance of it being messed up.  Though it's hard for her to access, she has returned to using the HP Deskjet 9800 that has been serving us well for years now.<br /><br />Unless anything changes, this will likely be my final update on this review.  I will still answer any questions of course.<br /><br />=====================<br />Mid-Term Update Summary<br />=====================<br />Scanning: Amazing, Beautiful, Faster than Fast. Seven stars.<br />Printing: Don't touch it with a ten foot pole and somebody else pushing.

This calendar is helpful in so many ways: days of the week, month, year, weather, holidays... and teaching numbers!      The years I received are 2009-2016, so it will last quite a while for us.    The colors are bold and vibrant, the calendar and pockets are sturdy.  My daughter loves to change the cards with me.  If the weather changes during the day she asks if we can change the card. Exciting.    The only con is that not all of the cards fit in the additional pockets, but I think the calendar would be too bulky if there were additional pockets or if the pockets were bigger.    Great learning tool - highly recommend this!	2011-06-06

Then, onto an old paperback that I picked up cheap, washed the cover (hey, germs, OK?) and reinforced for another read. Superb.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?

I can go to the very edge of my back yard which is about 75 feet from the base and the clarity is just as good as in the house.  The phones will display if someone is on another extension and if there is trouble with the phone line.  You can program individual ring tones for numbers that are saved in the phone book and it can announce the name of the person that you have associated with the number. The normal ring tone will sound first, but after the second ring when the Caller ID recognizes the number the individual ring tone will start. The speaker phone and intercom features function well.      I have been able to leave the phones off of the charger for several days without needing to recharge but we don't talk a lot on the phones so that would affect the time between changes.    We don't use the answering machine feature so I can't rate that part of it.  We are using our phones through a telephone service that connects to the USB port of our computer and utilizes the high-speed Internet connection.  Using the phones through this type of circuit requires that we sometimes dial the numbers a little slower than normal (about 1/2 second per digit) but that is not a problem with the phone ... just inherent to the telephone circuit.    With previous 2.4 ghz phones we did get interference and strange malfunctions but these phones use a special frequency that works well in our house with no interference with other devices.  Overall, we are very pleased with the phones especially since we bought them mainly for the range and lack of interference problems.	2008-07-10

I have used it on several occassions for up to 15 minutes of intermittent shredding and it has worked flawlessly.<br /><br />I have shredded up to 12 sheets of paper at one time (shredder works a little harder but still smoothly shreds), a couple of credit cards and approximately 15 CD/DVD disks. The operation with paper and credit cards is surprisingly quiet.  You could probably shred with someone sleeping in the next room and not wake them.  The noise level (dB) is probably doubled when shredding a computer disk, but it still is quieter than any other shredder I've worked with.<br /><br />One time the shredding process stopped with paper still sticking up above the shredder.  I had a pair of 8-10 bank checks, side by side, so that a total of 16-20 total checks were being shredded at one time. I thought that since the checks took only a fraction of the available space for feeding in paper that I could shred two stacks at one time.  Well, the shredder stopped. I pressed the reverse button for a couple of seconds, then the forward button until all the checks were gobbled up.  No further misfires since then, even doing the same thing again with checks.<br /><br />Everything functions as Fellowes states.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a small bottle of oil and several clear waste bags.  The bags work great.  The operating manual is brief but answers some essential questions like what to do with shredding malfunctions, what not to shred, how long to shred and maintenance.  While Fellowes tells you when to oil (at every waste bag exchange), Fellowes could have detailed exactly how to use their oil.  Hopefully Fellowes technical support will be helpful when a question arises.<br /><br />Shredded material size is as stated and is the same for paper as well as computer discs and credit cards.  There are units with more finely shredded material, and there are many units that do not shred as small.  A motivated thief with patience and plenty of time could reconstruct most any retail shredder's output. That said, a thief would most likely dumpster dive for someone else's unshredded documents before sifting through your well shredded ones.  Overall, I feel reasonably comfortable with the level of security of the shredded material with this unit.<br /><br />The construction and design appear to be of excellent quality with appropriate ruggedness.  There is no bowing or undue flexibility of the frame when the drawer is out as has been commented on with the Fellowes Powershred PS-77Cs Shredder.  The castors are resonably medium duty and can lock down to keep the unit from rolling away.  The shredder without the castors sits flat and stable.<br /><br />Would be nice to know about the quality of the internal parts.  I have read that some machines use plastic toothed gears which have higher/earlier failure rates than metal ones.  At least this shredder has a two year warranty for the entire unit, which is twice many competing machines.<br /><br />Overall, the PS-79Ci shredder is an excellent unit, working exactly as advertised.  The Fellowes website has a nice multimedia presentation on the operations of this unit, including the noise level.  I haven't had this unit for very long but I am extremely pleased so far with its performance and fit and finish.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a light to medium duty shredder for home or home-office, especially if they want a longer warranty, low noise operation, very good build quality and plenty of whistles and bells that actually are useful and work.e and plenty of time could reconstruct most any retail shredder's output.

In many ways the engineer's fine design was undercut by cheapening the manufacturing.  The bikes sold at half the price of similar bikes.  The owners of the property lent me one bike and I rode it for a few hundred miles until a bearing failed.  It also had a skip when I put on pressure in a high gear but that could've been how the axle wiggled.  The owners just gave me the other bike.  It always skipped under pressure in the top gear going up a steep incline or sometimes starting out.  I read and read and tried to figure it out.  This bike has only a couple hundred miles on it.  Today I turned it upside down to check for a frozen chain link and examine it carefully.  And there was the problem: The 14 tooth sprocket was worn into wide oval valleys in only about 200 miles.  I've had shoes that lasted longer.  The crank/chain/shifter system is a mixture of Koei, Shimano and Sun Run.  The Sun Run cassette had worn out the small sprocket.  It's almost new and completely worn out.  Shimano only costs a few bucks more.  I don't see a reason to buy Sun Run.	2015-08-26

I'm 5'8\""	It worked well for my 3 weekend trips. it held my 2-p tent, ultralight sleeping bag, pad, pillow, lights, cookware, a machete, and water, and still a few liters of empty room. It certainly will work for week long trips.<br />A note on proper use - the first night it gave me pain on both shoulders. That was alleviated after I loosened up the shoulder strips and let more wait goes on the  hip. that way, it also leave about an inch wide gap between my back and the pack to allow a breeze to keep my back cool. I'm 5'8&#34;. People taller than 6' may find difficult to  distribute the weight to their hips.<br />It does not have a bottom opening or separate sleeping bag compartment. The packet on the waist belt well keeps keys, cel phone, and lighters. It would be better if there were one or two additional side pockets. However, this pack is simple, sturdy, and, unless you want to spend &#62;$200, this one works well for many backpackers.	2015-08-24

There is enough for two people to be satisfied and not over-full which is good when you're going to hike 8 or 10 miles.	2015-06-10

I bought the med to use as a stuff sack for a 20 deg North Face sleeping bad.  Some said they couldn't get their bag into the small.  I don't think they understand the theory behind a &#34;stuff sack.&#34;  The med is way bigger than what I need.  Should have gone with small, but the med will work great too as it will compress down (of course).	2015-06-10

I needed a bed easy to move as I landed in LA and couldnt find good housing so I moved a lot till I finally got some what settled. Not having the hassle of moving a full size bed was one less headache. Its comfortable and doesnt lose air.

Just got this and was very impressed with the belt. It's bright yellow is visible enough in the daytime and the reflective strips are great at night. The belt itself is sturdy elastic with heavy duty military type clip closure that is adjustable. This will be great not only for running/walking but I can envision using it camping on my dogs while walking them with the retractable leashes (sounds crazy I know but they can be far in front so it'll be easier to see them). If you only plan to walk I believe that the elastic would hold your phone securely in place instead of - like some of us putting it in the bra--  if you are a runner I don't see this rubbing because it's quite soft and flexible. Another great idea for this would be to put around your luggage so it's easily identifiable in the baggage claim. But I digress because I can think of so many uses but it is a running belt worth the price and perfect for its intended use and so much more. Recommend highly.<br />Received free for my honest review	2015-05-20

Product has received excellent reviews on several websites ranking this air mattress among the &#34;Top Five,&#34; &#34;Top Ten,&#34; etc.<br /><br />Perhaps I received the odd one out which is defective, or, perhaps these reviews are based more on hopeful legend than actual performance.<br /><br />Despite following all instructions re &#34;inflating for the first time,&#34; etc., this mattress leaked air.  It leaked A LOT of air -- to the degree that this air mattress could have passed for a floor pancake.  And, leaked the same amount of air consistently, for all five nights my guests slept on it.<br />Fortunately, my guests had both resilient spines and a great sense of humor.<br />I am extremely disappointed with the performance of this product and will be returning it.	2015-05-19

It has quite a wide brim and blocks the sun wonderfully.  It looks pretty good and allows even the most gentle breeze to pass through the top and cool your head.  I recommend it for anyone who will be out in the sun and heat.<br /><br />Notice that this is a pretty rigid hat.  Many cloth hats like this will flop down and very easily crush.  This hat feels more rigid, like a straw hat or even more rigid, like a cowboy hat.  It's made of crushable materials that will bounce back, but it's not the kind of hat that you would roll up or anything.  It's just not as cloth-y as one might expect with cheaper hats that have this look.<br /><br />It doesn't exactly conform to your head easily either.  Mine is just about the right circumference, but it's a bit too round for my head (my head is longer and narrower).  As a result it squeezes the front and back of my head but hardly touches the sides.  It's not super uncomfy or anything, but it's more rigid than expected.<br /><br />I think my head circumference is like 23 inches and I got a large...it's the right size.	2015-05-11

I cant say that i love it because i have not tried it. Im wanting to keep it put away for emergency use (when the the yellow stone volcano blows, someone drops a nuke on us, the zombies come or another asteroid hits the earth). I would like to know If the dates on the buckets match the dates on the pouches. Only one way to find out. I gotta open the bucket. But then there goes my 20 year shelf life! all of the sudden i better get to eating because i just lost 19 years of shelf life. Kind of a scam really. Many people have stated that they open the buckets and find products with only a year or two left before the item expires but yet the sticker on the outside of the bucket is for 20 or more years from now. Whats the deal?!?!?! Should the expiration date on the outside of the bucket be the same as the expiration dates on the pouches of food inside the buckets???? A lot of good it does to open the bucket in 2030 and find out that the contents expired in 2017. Does anyone see the problem with that?	2015-05-09

This bottle is really amazing! I love that it does what it promises; I still can't get over the feeling of picking up a room-temperature bottle and drinking frigid water or steaming coffee or tea out of it! I would rarely finish 24 oz of any drink all at once, and would constantly be re-warming them in the microwave (welcome to parenthood). This is a much better option! I am so grateful. I hesitated purchasing something I've never held in my hands before, but this bottle was just as expected (the 24 oz narrow mouth seems to be what the girl in the hat in the picture is holding with the Green Zen color). I fill my ice cube trays less than full, and they fit in perfectly. The narrow mouth means I'm not splooshing all over the place. VERY HAPPY with this!	2014-08-22

However, the mesh closure/flap and velcro are not easy to deal with while riding. I must say that it's still much simpler than dealing with the bags that hang from the rear underside of your bike seat. I much prefer the other version of this bag that has the magnetic closure top that closes more like a lid. Beyond that, this is a great bag, large enough to fit phone, cash, keys, garage door opener, etc. and it still merits five stars.<br /><br />I bought this mesh top version first, but kept it because it also fits at my seat post and is great for the garage door opener and my wallet. I know that all the contents will remain securely in place, even if I go offroad.	2014-08-05

When I looked at the tube, the slime had leaked out and so did all of the air.  The slime that leaked out made it impossible to easily repair the tube.  There is no doubt that the extra cost of the slime tube is a complete waste of money.<br /><br />My hybrid tires recommend an inflation pressure of 75 pounds.  I expect there are cases where the tire recommends a lower pressure and the slime might work.  From everything that I have read, this inflation pressure is typical of at least hybrid and road bikes.  Since this tube size is only used on hybrid and road bikes, I strongly recommend against purchasing this product in this size or any 700C sized.	2014-06-30

I've desired this watch since first seeing it in Afghanistan in 2008.  I finally had the opportunity to purchase and didn't waste anymore time. This watch has met all of my expectations.

This is the best rear visibility light on the market. The Catseye Rapid 5 runs a close second. They both use 2 AAA batteries which means you can go with rechargables & still have the option to buy batteries at the corner store if your light dies mid ride. Watch batteries get mighty expensive & aren't available everywhere which precludes many other lights from my best ever list. What makes the Planet Bike Turbo better than the rest is economy, it uses 3 lights which saves a little battery, it does this without sacrificing visibility. The strobe pattern is very hard to ignore & the larger lamp is very bright for a steady on light (blinking rear lights are illegal in some places). The other thing that puts the Turbo above Catseye Rapid 5 is the design, it can be clipped on your belt/waistband as well as into it's &#34;dock.&#34;  While Catseye makes lights that clip on they are not nearly this bright or eye catching.	2013-09-20

The biggest problem is, it is already rusting which isn't good for a beach or outdoor chair.  And when it rains, rust water pours out of it staining everything in it's path.  It also has strange recline settings.  It is pretty much all or nothing (full upright or full flat laying down) unless I haven't figured it out.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW: Went from \\\\\"It's ok\\\\\" and three stars for it's cool concept but went down to one star after a few months of use.  Just like everyone said, after a few months a rip was in the seam and that was it.  It tore so it was unusable.  And again, this was from small weight.  And the rust pouring out that I mentioned got super annoying.  Constant power washing had to be done.  I am trying to get the company contact info to see if they will refund.

I bought one of these a while back to take with me on canoeing trips. I wanted something in stainless steel that I would not have to worry about if it got submerged or was around water all the time. Mora's carbon steel blades are excellent, but in this case, I would have to always worry about keeping the knife dry and oiled. I go on these trips several times a year and this knife has proven to be another great Mora knife. I love the blade profile on this knife and the handle has proven to grip nicely even when wet. Made of Swedish SS, the blade sharpens relatively easy and holds an edge well. I actually bought several more of these as a result and keep one in my tackle box as well.<br /><br />It was on one of these canoeing trips that my friend (we'll call him Chuck) saw my Mora knife for the first time and joked about the &#34;cheap plastic Chinese crap&#34; that I brought along. He then began to brag on his $160 knife that he brought. Chuck is one of these types who follows the rule that more expensive equals better. I simply grinned and mentioned that it was in fact Swedish made and not Chinese. Our guide however (we use an outfitters), overheard the conversation and noticed my knife. He immediately recognized the brand and commented on how good Mora knives are. Then he rummaged around his pack and produced a well used Mora classic (no. 2 I believe), and mentioned how he never went out without a Mora in his pack.<br /><br />Looking for some sort of validation on his $160 dollar knife, he asked the guide what he thought of his nice expensive knife. The guide simply said &#34;yeah that's nice. Looks expensive.&#34;. After that Chuck didn't do much bragging. Don't get me wrong, his $160 knife was a nice knife, however, and as I pointed out to him later, who would be worse off if they lost their knife in the river? Him and his $160 dollar knife, or me and my $35 dollar Mora? The moral of the story? Just because it's more expensive doesn't mean it's always better. Those who use and have an appreciation of good knives know Mora quality. Mora is pretty much universally recognized for their inexpensive yet high quality blades.<br /><br />You simply can't go wrong with Mora.se who use and have an appreciation of good knives know Mora quality.

I was assured by an Abus employee that this does not affect the strength of the lock. I hope that's correct. I still endorse this as a great medium-high risk lock.<br /><br />Also, I eventually purchased the top of the line [[ASIN:B00GBNW2CE Abus Bordo Granit X-Plus 6500 Foldable Lock - 85cm]] and can attest to it being worth the money over this lock. If you can afford it, and don't mind some extra weight, I say get the Bordo 6500. It's definitely a cut above this lock.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />These Bordo locks are a curiosity in design, but I'm a believer. It offers some of the flexibility and convenience of a chain, yet the segments are surely stronger than chain links.<br /><br />There are basically three grades of Bordo locks, plus the combo version. This one, the 6000, is the middle range --the low-end is the `lite' Bordo; the high-end is the burly 6500. (Personally I would not bother with the 'lite' version unless your bike is low-value. And while I don't own the 6500 model, I can attest to having seen it in person that it is very intimidating and probably super strong.)<br /><br />All-in-all I'm pretty pleased with this lock for general security. It's quite convenient to transport as well. Finally I have a semi-serious lock that I can leave attached to my bike so I always have it with me. Typically I use it in conjunction with a U-lock (lately the [[ASIN:B0026B4RBO Abus Locks U 64 Mini Futura Bike Lock]]).<br /><br />Pros:<br />--Transport: This model comes with a carrying sheath with velcro canvas straps. The straps themselves are quite strong. I carry mine horizontally on my rear rack which I find to be very convenient. But with the straps you can pretty much adhere the sheath to some other part of the frame.<br />--When folded up, the lock is quite compact compared to U-locks. It's also very 'self-contained' when compared to loose chains. Maybe think of two stacked oversize TV remotes to get a very general idea.<br />--The segments and locking mechanism are coated with rubber or some kind of silicone to keep from scratching the bicycle frame.<br />--In the US, Abus is new and lesser used than Kryptonite. This is a plus with regards to seasoned thieves who might specialize in defeating Kryptonites, but are confused by Abus.<br /><br />Cons:<br />--The end of the segment links (where it inserts into the locking mechanism) is exposed metal. I find I need to be careful when locking up my bike that this end piece does not swing down and whack against my paint finish. Also the joints between segments are not coated metal. Not a huge problem, but you could scratch your finish if you're careless when locking.<br />--All locks can be defeated. This one seems inhibitive of leverage attacks, and hand-sawing seems like it would be a pain. Bolt cutters, except for the huge ones, probably would have a hard time getting a good grip on the segments. So I think a sledgehammer attack would probably be the brute force method most likely to break this lock. Underneath the rubber coating, the locking mechanism seems a little under-engineered. But of course this is the mid-range and therefore I'm not docking stars for this. I got what I paid for. And let's face it --we can never have a lock that is too secure, right?so very 'self-contained' when compared to loose chains.

The only thing that ticked me off was the plugs that came with the blue tape was not black how it shows in the big picture. They are red with white S on it.

It looks alittle stronger than some trikes, the price and free shipping and the six speeds.<br />Assembly was a challenge. The instructions were for a different trike and gave you only a few instructions and they basically were useless. Since I am mechanically inclined and have worked on bikes all my life, I took the challenge to put it together myself. After alot of trial and error, mostly error, I got it together. The first thing I realized is that the seat with the back is entirely too small and I couldn't tighten the seat enough to keep it from moving. I bought a new seat and after closer examination I saw the back can be taken off. It is great to ride, but needs a little getting used to. You need to be careful so you don't get on slopes sideways, like the end of a driveway. It can easily be turned over, if not careful. A little leaning the right way helps. I look forward to riding it all over our development when the weather is nicer.<br /><br />The shipper was very helpful. The web said that it didn't contain instructions and had to send for them I did that and they sent them the same day, by e-mail. They were for another trike. There were instructions in the box, but were the same as the e-mail. There was no color choice given,, but the company themselves called me  and wondered what color I wanted. The package came a day before promised and had only a small tear in the box.<br /><br />Amazon had a price of $409.90 and free shipping, but e-bay had them for $80.00 less but $80.00 shipping.<br /><br />So far to me it is a great trike and am glad I can again get to riding.	2013-02-27

The Coleman Folding Shovel fits the bill with its hardy construction and small, space saving, design. The shovel end folds up so it is compact, taking up very little room. Yet, when it is down, it locks in firmly and there is no worry about it collapsing on you as you dig into the ground or are transporting hot coals from one area to another. Haven't tried digging out a tire, yet, but have tried just digging into the ground and moving embers around. Love it! I don't think I will be digging trenches with it but it is a handy little tool to have, doesn't take up much space and beats using my hands but far!<br /><br />Essential Tools for a successful camping trip<br /> Multi-use hatchet/hammer<br /> Multi-use pocket knife with flint<br /> Folding Shovel<br /> Flashlight<br /> Lantern<br /> Campstove<br /> Cooler<br /> Bucket<br /> Tarp<br /> Twine/Jute/Thin rope<br /> Duct tape (BIG roll)<br /> Eating and cooking implements<br />With these items you can make any kind of camping fun and, relatively, smooth going. The hatchet and hammer, combo, comes in so handy. You need it to cut those limbs for the hot dog and marshmallow sticks. To split your kindling and the smaller logs for your fire. The hammer you can use to pound down the tent stakes or the tarp for that unexpected rain that will fall no matter what the weather forecast says is going to happen. The shovel is great for making fire pits, or cooler pits, for keeping the coals together and banking them for the night or spreading them out so you can easily douse the fire before you leave and cover the pit back up with dirt. The multi-use pocket knife is great for whittling the sticks small enough for marshmallows, has tweezers to get out those pesky splinters, pliers to pull out the hook lodged in the fish (or your hand). Flashlight and Lanterns are a must for night time, make sure you grab extra batteries and/or fuel.If using fuel be sure to also get extra mantels. A cooler is great if you aren't planning on digging a cooler pit. A bucket is a must for hauling the water, transporting the fish/crawdads, washing dishes, feet or the baby! The tarp can be used under the tent, over the tent or for a wind break. Twine/Jute will hold the tarp in place, the table cloth on the picnic table, the dog to the picnic table, the baby to the picnic table (just joking). Duct tape, a must have. It is water resistant. It will patch your tent, your tarp, your shoes, your coat. It, too, will hold your dog to the picnic table. Don't use it on the baby, to hard (and painful) to get off. Authorities frown on it. Unless you are really roughing it cooking over the fire is pretty hard, you can burn the hair off your arms (and your eyebrows depending on the height of the fire and the length of your arms) so get a camp stove and the right cooking implements.	2012-10-19

This bottle does what it is supposed to.  It keeps water cold for a very long time.<br /><br />It is a bit larger than I would have liked and from what I expected from a 25oz bottle.  The bottle I was replacing was a NeoVas single wall 40oz bottle with a NeoTote neoprene wrap to insulate it.  I was looking for a smaller bottle that was insulated that would also fit in a cup holder in my car, bike, etc...These two bottles have nearly identical dimensions.  The 25oz ecovessel is 11 1/8in tall and has a diameter of roughly 3 3/8in.  I normally would complain about this, but it is also my fault for not contacting the company to verify the dimensions (which were not listed on their website either)<br /><br />I would have to give this bottle at least 7 stars for performance.  I haven't tried anything hot yet, but I can put ice and cold water in the bottle in the morning, keep refilling with more water throughout the day (usually at least 8 refills) and there is still some ice left the next morning when I wake up.  Phenomenal!!!<br /><br />I may just have to purchase the 17oz size for when I jump on my bike :)	2012-08-22

I've owned probably a dozen pair of riding gloves and never had an experience like this with any of them. I like the fit and the looks of the Monaco, and perhaps the pair I received was a just a rare exception (in which case Giro ought to institute a bit more quality control), but I'm going to order a different glove entirely instead of having Amazon send me a new pair of these. The 30 seconds I spent with these gloves didn't inspire much confidence in their quality.	2012-07-19

Also because when I ate it I wasn't out hiking thus tired and hungry or didn't anything to really help make it seem better, Because when unpacking it I accidentally cut it open and note it comes tightly packed thus when opening the envelope/package it's in be careful.  Anyways I followed the instructions as written on the back of the package (but used a bowl covered in plastic wrap as my bag since like i said cut open the original) and put it on a tortilla then sprinkled some of a seasoning mix that comes with it (which is a nice addition to this) and rolled it up and found it to be quite good not ok like most maintain house meals. So would I buy this again yeah i'd give it another go but I wouldn't eat it without tortillas because easier to eat and also helps counter the picky eater I am.

In my first attempt to brush their teeth, I used a dental kit for cats that I had purchased at a pet store. The toothpaste in the kit was mint flavored, and neither cat liked it. In fact, one cat absolutely hated it.  There's got to be a better way!  I tried dental treats, but I'm pretty sure my cats weren't really chewing them. No, we needed to go back to brushing. I thought, &#34;If I were a cat, what flavor of toothpaste would I want?&#34;  So, I searched Amazon for fish- or chicken-flavored toothpaste. I found this brand and purchased the poultry flavor.  My cats really aren't fans of toothbrushing in general. So, I started by letting them have a very small taste of the paste. They loved it. Then, I introduced them to the paste on the tip of an oral swab. The final step was getting in some actual brush action.  My cats still do not adore their daily dental hygiene time, but this toothpaste makes the experience much easier for all involved parties. Both cats typically come to me when they hear me preparing for their brushing session. When it's time to be brushed, each cat actually will grab my wrist with both paws to pull the toothpaste-tipped swab closer. I let each cat have a tiny taste before brushing begins.  I'm very happy that my cats like this toothpaste and--kind of, sort of--look forward to brushing sessions. My cats used to resist brushing so much; I never thought I'd be brushing their teeth daily!	2015-08-04

It's not super high quality, probably along the lines of Ikea furniture build. I didn't use the divider so I could put the Breeze litter box inside. The first few days I left the doors open since the kitties have never used a covered box before. After a week I closed one door, and now I keep it closed all the time. The cats took to it quickly and go in there with no problems. They actually seem to like it more than the uncovered box we still have! After reading previous reviews, I kept the high sides on the Breeze box, and lined the bottom of the cabinet with a waterproof mat. Neither one of our cats tends to pee over the side of the box, although one likes to kick pellets everywhere. Luckily since the box is so far inside the cabinet, none of the pellets makes it outside. It won't do much for the smell if your cats make particularly rank stink-bombs (like one of ours), but at least no one has to see it. All in all we're very satisfied! Might even get another one for the upstairs room!	2015-06-26

Since I cannot personally review this item, I can say my dog doesn't like them at all. He normally loves chewing on treats and bones, but this he will have nothing to do with. I tried pretending like I was liking it..nothing. I tried being excited while giving it to him..nothing. He has picked it up and moved it to a room he doesn't usually go in, but that is about it. He is a 20-22lb two year old Italian Greyhound mix. I guess you have to try different things and see what they like! Unfortunately, this wasn't it.	2015-06-12

I was skeptical at first being many reviews explained burn marks, a cheaper feel, junk, etc but I am very happy I took the risk anyways!! I have a 70lbs pitbull who gets a little too excited around people, as well as loves to roll around under our porch (which is nothing but dirt) and there are just little things here & there she does that we don't like. I purchased the collar, had to charge it and the remote for about half a day, and right away my dog responded very well to only the beep sound. I hardly ever have to use the vibrate or shock setting (but they too work well for the times she didn't respond to the beep sound and are adjustable for the strength of each) the remote & collar do have a cheaper feel to them, but we've had this for about 2 weeks now, so far so good. I don't trust hooking her leash to the collar itself (being she's so strong) but the shocker is attachable to stronger collar we already had. Honestly that's the worst thing about this. We have not experienced burns or having to constantly charge the things. I would say a great buy for the price! Most training collars are outrageously priced but this one I consider amazing! Great buy and I would recommend to anyone having a few training issues (:	2015-06-08

I looked at a lot of different pet strollers online and decided on this one based on the reviews. After having it for a few days and literally walking 10 miles with it, I still love it. Pros to the stroller: The smallish compact size allows me to get in and out of buildings and restaurants easily and doesn't take up much more room than a chair at the table would. The back zipper is easy to open and close and my preferred method of getting my two chihuahuas in it. I love that I can see my pets through the top mesh screen and the back screen. The basket holds quite a bit of things in it, we went out shopping for produce at a local farmers market with it. Having a tray on top with cup holders and a flat space to stash a phone makes it super convenient. Folds down quickly and easily with the turn of the hand and a push down. Very light also, allows me to pick it up to go down stairs or up curbs.This stroller pushes very easily, so it makes a great walking stroller for someone out for exercise. There is a leash snap inside the pet area, but only one, and I have two tiny dogs. I do not use it since mine are zipped up inside the whole time, but wanted people who plan on putting multiple pets inside to know. The Cons: I'm tall , and even though the bar is at an acceptable height, due to the design being so upright, I end up being very close to the lower wheels and bar, so I kick it often with a normal stride. Not a major thing, but just annoying. Also, the front zipper is not easy to use. Once we had it assembled, we just don't use it unless we collapse it to put it in the car. The front zipper must be undone in order to fold it up. It seems sturdy enough, just very hard to start and then get zipped all the way around. I don't use it, I just use the back one for access. Also, the cup holders are not very deep, since plan on stuff falling over, so pack liquids in a container that seals shut, they jiggled out even on concrete flat roads.<br /><br />Something I read quite a bit about was the wheels. I was worried about them being sturdy enough since I read they were foam-ish. They are indeed a very dense foam material. After doing several miles over concrete and a little over gravel road, they have held up well. I don't know for how long they may stay acceptable, so I may look around for replacement wheels since I plan on using this daily to get more exercise and go shopping. For the money, this was definitely a nice stroller, and I would definitely buy another one like it.	2014-12-24

Yes, the [[ASIN:B00PZKFIXE Attmu Silicone Pet Expandable and Collapsible Food and Water Travel Bowl Set]] is marketed as a travel bowl set, but these are so great, I use them most days for wet and dry food in the house.  The package includes a set of 6, all different colors.  My dog loves the colors (even though science tells us they can't see colors); they draw her attention and add a fun pop to the room too.<br /><br />These bowls fold up flat, great for vacations with the dog, or even a long walk.  Each bowl has a notch with a hole in it, perfect for putting on a carabiner (not included) and attaching to my belt loop on a walk, then pull out a water bottle and fill it up.  Dump the rest when shes done and pop it back closed and reattach to my belt, simple.<br /><br />Love that they are silicone making for easy clean up, and I have already run them through the dishwasher twice, no issues.  Overall, incredibly pleased with this [[ASIN:B00PZKFIXE Attmu Silicone Pet Expandable and Collapsible Food and Water Travel Bowl Set]].<br /><br />[Review Sample Provided For Review and Evaluation]	2014-12-15

This stuff is great, and I love that its not completely full of chemicals, and a very strong scent.

Tried lots of other products,  and got tired of being ripped off with all the promises,  and high prices.  Decided to have &#34;one more go&#34;,  but only because of the low price.

It'll kill all the live fleas,  but not the eggs. Do this once a month,  and eventually  all the unhatched eggs hatch,  and the next treatment will kill those fleas. within a couple of months your cat will be free of all the fleas. Don't get suckered into buying the &#34;high priced stuff&#34;.

It is really amazing stuff. It clumps around cat urine to form almost rock hard lumps that can easily be gathered up and thrown away. The clumps never bread apart and they reduce odor to almost nothing. That said, when I put the Precious Cat litter in the Pet Zone EZ Scoop litter box and then tried to clean it the way described in the instructions, the scoop that is the key feature of the box would not move at all. the Precious Cat litter was just too much for it to move. I gave it a real try, but after three weeks I removed the cleaning system entirely and just used it like a regular litter box.<br /><br />Now, if you use a different kind of litter this might work for you. Some like the sawdust style of litter, or pine chips. They would probably work just fine. Or clumping litter that doesn't clump very hard might work well. But If you are a Previous Cat fan like I am, this litter box simply doesn't do the job. Which is too bad, because I really liked the idea behind it.	2014-06-18

So we have been using this ball for about 2 weeks now.  I haven't seen any noticeable weight loss in my cat yet but she is very overweight so it may be a while.<br /><br />We have however noticed changes in her behavior.  She always wants to eat but is very overweight and has to have her portions controlled.  We were having problems with her acting out around her feeding time or anytime we went into the kitchen.  She would grab onto our legs and hold on if we were trying to exit without feeding her.  Since using the ball she seems to realize she is in control of feeding herself.  If she wants food she will spend time in the kitchen messing around with the ball for food instead of tearing up the couch and attacking our legs.  She seems happier and less stressed even though she is still getting her same sized potion of food.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for people with cats that seem to have an insatiable appetite that act out because of it.	2014-04-25

She said that she went through two of these litter boxes after one broke and she decided it was cheaper to buy another one than fix the old one. NOW I WISH I HAD KEPT HER OLD ONE and fixed it and gifted it to someone, ANYONE because this thing is ESSENTIAL. I can't believe I have gone my entire life without one of these until recently. I have two cats and i cut them from their old litter box to this one cold turkey and they took to it in a day (they had no choice, no where else to potty but my cats are older so they aren't lost confused kittens). I have been using it for over two months now and some times the sensor doesn't trip and i have to manually push the &#34;cycle&#34; button to clean the box BUT its better than scooping it each time. I change the litter drawer out once a week, which gives me enough time to go away and come home and not have to worry about the litter being cleaned.	2014-01-04

US	13950759	R34QBJHRNE9SEC	B0043XCX0U	610411484	Primetime Petz 360 Configurable Gate with Door 30 in. - Walnut	Pet Products	3	0	0	N	Y	Great so long as your dogs view gates as psychological barrier	I would actually rate this a 3.5. This works perfect for what I needed, keeps my dogs (two, 40lb pit mixes) from bolting out of my unit into the common space/hallway every time I open the door, and looks great- very stylish. My entrance is also awkwardly shaped, so a regular gate wouldn't work. The door to my unit opens into the unit, and while the wall behind the door- as I open the door, the wall on the left- is about 4' long (so more than long enough to place a gate and still have space for the door to open fully), the door to the right is only about 3' long, so to put in a normal straight gate that you can brace onto the walls, I could never open the door to my unit more than partially. The ability to configure this gate in a U/W shape works perfect for the space. And my dogs no longer sprint into the hallway when I come home, or when visitors come over- it creats a sort of mini-foyer. That said, it only gets 3.5 stars because it is super flimsy; seriously, I tell friends if they sneeze over it, it might fall over. And in the time I've had it (several months) I think it's actually gotten more flimsy. I hope it doesn't fall apart soon, because it wasn't cheap. I knew that I would be sacrificing some stability by purchasing a free-standing gate, but this is even more unstable than I expected. That said, I still think it was a good purchase and because my dogs view any type of gate/barrier as impossible to get over (for them, it is psychological), it works great. But if you have a dog prone to pushing things, this would constantly collapse and wouldn't work well.	2013-12-31

(only if you want to see your dog die)	This is one of many items that is known to cause kidney failure / death in dogs. My beloved dog passed away due to kidney failure a few days ago. We had been feeding this 'treat' to our dog for a few years.. it was his favorite treat. Upon research, we were basically feeding him dried death sticks. After our vet gave him a blood test and reviewed his diet, she said that the chicken jerky that we have been feeding him had been slowing destroying his kidney.<br /><br />He was 4 years old.<br /><br />Kingdom Pets, Waggin Train (sold at Costco for many months), Duck Jerky.

It scared my Collie tho and she hid under the bed.  Four stars because it is true if you leave it turned on for a long period (over night) it runs the battery down.  We use it on our deck, and have used it inside, but our Collie must have very sensitive hearing, so it makes her too nervous, we only use it inside when they are really really disruptive - and it shuts them right up.	2013-11-15

The house is a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  There is no room for my cat to get into the position he uses when he scratches on his other cardboard scratching boards. Before I put it together, he would try to use the scratching bottom, as it lay out, uncovered, on the floor, but once I got the house all put together, he wouldn't use it..  He may hide in the house once in a while, when playing with his brother, but that's the extent of it.  The house. Is just too small on the inside to motivate him to scratch.	2013-10-29

This sweeper does not stay extended, it collapses as soon as you put pressure on it.  When getting hair out of your carpet you need a rubber brush to really dig in to get it out.  The bristles on this sweeper are long and weak. Even if the handle stayed extended, it wouldn't help much.

I spent quite a bit of time looking thru products and reviews to find pj's with longer legs for my Rat Terrier mix (20 lbs).

Her legs come out of the back if I leave them on for awhile, but rolling them up once or twice seems to help.<br /><br />We get lots of comments and laughs about how cute she looks from the neighbors!	2012-12-15

When he gets to barking, it's loud and annoying; he gets fixated on the other dog or (worse) a nearby deer (or bird, or the kids, or ...) and he seems to lose awareness of anything else. Combine that with an overly sensitive neighbor and it's a recipe for frustration!    I tried behavior training, sprays, sonic birdhouses etc. But nothing worked. This has.    Pros:  - It's nice having one control for two collars.  - I like having multiple corrections (vibrate, sound)  - It works.    Cons:  - As mentioned in other reviews, confusing instructions. But I did find the You-Tube videos helpful.  - There's a button on the remote that delivers an escalating correction, starting with a beep, then a vibrate, then a shock. You also use this button (by holding it down longer) to switch from one collar to the other. That's poor design and we have regularly accidentally delivered the escalating correction when we really wanted to switch control.  - Switching controls from one collar to the other takes a second or two and sometimes that's too long. You often need to issue the correction more quickly than that, so the dog recognizes the behavior that's being addressed. A long transition means missed opportunities.  - The correction has occasionally gone off on its own. Confusing to the dogs.  - You can set any of the corrections (i.e. the shock) to zero so that if you accidentally press the shock button, the dogs won't feel it. But if you press the escalation button, a shock is still delivered, even though it was set to zero.      For our situation, we've got an invisible fence, so the dogs already wear a collar that will deliver a shock when they go too close to the boundary. I didn't want to use this collar to issue shocks and potentially confuse them. My original solution was to simply set the shock to zero and that sometimes worked, but as I mentionedabove between the accidental escalations and occasional corrections that got issued even though we didn't push the button, I wasn't happy with that. My solution was to open up the collars and to cut the wires that delivered the shocks. Problem solved.    I use the vibration when the dogs bark more than is appropriate and the beep to indicate I want them to get away from something. In general, this works well.     The big payoff for me has been my big dobie, who has had a barking problem is now MUCH more under control. I'm sure there are better products out there, but overall, I'm very pleased with the results here.	2011-08-25

Of course I had to try one because the dogs love them-there's nothing nasty in them, all good ingredients. Tastes kind of like an Oreo, but less sweet.<br />So this is a really good deal on these. Too bad for a couple of reviewers' dogs that they didn't sit well but that's what you have to do, keep trying different types until you find what works with your animal.

He came to me with fairly dull coat, a small patch of fur missing and he seemed to sleep more than usual. Then I ordered these chews after researching supplements for FIV+ cats.  They arrived at the same time my cat developed a cold.      He assimilated to taking these chews extremely well and gobbles them right up, but, best of all, his coat has become extremely glossy, his cold has gone away completely and that missing patch of fur is getting smaller every day.  All of this after only TWO days of supplementation.  I also give him the Vetri-Science chewable supplement called Nu-Cat that has vitamins minerals, amino acids and enzymes.  His energy level has also increased.  I recommend thses chews very highly for nayone who wants to boost the immune system and overall health of their feline friends(s).    This is a high quality product from a well respected company.  I have seen the results with my own eyes, and firmly believe that my cat's health can only improve and continue to be proteced even more as I continue to use it.

I have a high energy dog who barks constantly at everything (mostly birds flying through the air outside).  The first day I put the shirt on her, her behavior changed immediately.  She went from crazy active to calm and sedate (without looking upset, like she does with a shock collar on).  We've had it over a month already, and we've noticed an huge decrease in her barking.  On days when she does bark, I simply tighten the shirt, and it calms her down again.  She also doesn't go as crazy when the mailman comes.   Another bonus - it minimizes how often she jumps on people (which used to be a problem)!     Overall, I would really recommend this Thundershirt for barking dogs.  It's made a big difference in my dog. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that there are times where it has been ineffective, but that might be that it wasn't on tight enough...	2011-07-09

Like the others, I saw this 25-pack of snozzles at a price too good to be true, and naively purchased them immediately for my dogs. They were listed and sold by PetCo. When they came, I got one huge box, containing a lot of stuffing paper, and a single tiny snozzle....joke was on me it seems.<br /><br />After this, PetCo emailed me a generic message saying there was a discrepancy with the item listing, and they sent me the wrong amount. I emailed PetCo and never received a response. I checked their seller profile, and found a gigantic archive of negative seller ratings, many of them specifically related to the same issue I was experiencing. I then emailed them a few more times. I'm not surprised they never answered a single one of them. Probably too backed up with hundreds of other emails like mine.<br /><br />I never did get my other 24 snozzles, although they refunded me, probably because I kept emailing them. I gave my dog the single snozzle we got, and they did not even want it. I examined it, and it has a chemical smell to it, and looks old. It is quite unfair how someone does this, and can just get away with it, and one does not even get a personal apology.<br /><br />I have decided to join a few others in going to the Better Business Bureau about this. Hope you decide to join in too.	2010-12-15

The downside? The cost of the disposable litterboxes (and the waste of course). I try to change them up every 3 weeks (I have two small cats) and that helps cut down on costs. I tried using the permanent tray, which you can buy online, and it didn't work as well (and I am lazy and didn't feel like washing it out every few weeks). But I'm sure you could just buy that to reduce costs (you'll still have to purchase litter, though).     One other thing: the litter tracks more than the clumping litter but my cat isn't allergic to it like she was with the clumping stuff, so that's a plus, really.

She's a very big dog so I increased the dosage, but still noticed no improvement.  My vet recommended the product and said it worked on about 30-40% of dogs, so I'm disappointed mine wasn't among them.  Still I might try a stronger version of Choline now that I know  about it and how it might help.  It was worth a try.	2009-11-12

I purchased both the small and the large so I can move them around and use them in different areas.  The height is perfect for small dogs, especially when placed on areas without carpeting (they can't launch off of hardwood floors easily).  The height also makes them easy to step over.  I always get positive comments about the appearance when guests visit.  They look like furniture.	2009-04-18

Before I start, I should mention I purchased the '09s but the '10s should be the same or better. Seeing there are no more '09s selling on amazon, I can give my review of snowjam's newer skiboards for those who need a review. First, what makes these skis so nice is the fact of price. I payed 180 for mine and no problems with them whatsoever. I am an avid skier, also a adrenaline junkie. When it came to skiing, I didn't like that long skis are almost $300 for a good pair. What made it even harder was that skiboards from revel 8 and good companies like that sold them for $250 WITHOUT BINDINGS. I looked more into it and found that you have to look for certain areas in cheaper skiboards to make sure you will not have problems. One was the 8 screw plastic binding problem. If this were on a ski you are looking for, it could pose the problem of the bindings breaking or snapping. The next was a wood or carbon core. Revel 8 carries carbon cores now I believe but mine was a oak core. If you get one with a weaker core, I have heard of breaking problems on the skis with them. Also, if someone is looking for skiboards that are reasonably priced, snowjam is a good way to go. They are one of the cheapest but quality made skiboards in the US. The only time I have heard of snowjams breaking was their earlier models like 4-5 years ago. Other than that, I took my skis through all kinds of terrain last year and they held up really well. My last advice on these would be if they haven't fixed the screw's problem of slipping out of the bindings, just put some lock-tite on them and you won't regret getting these skis.	2010-06-22

First I bought a metal bottle from local store. I returned it as I could not use the bottle; I could not hold the bottle with cold or hot water filled in. Next I searched on Amazon and found good reviews for this bottle and so I bought the silver bottle. I received the item pretty quickly. I liked the look of the bottle, it was better than the images on the website. I was really impressed with the insulation. The bottle kept the water inside hot or cold for nearly 5-6 hrs and I could fill in very hot or cold water with ice.     Few minor negatives, which does not affect me much.  The Sprout cap is a screw cap, bit inconvenient when drinking or filling water.  The cap needs to be fully tight else water will drip while drinking.  This bottle has a filter, which I did not find useful. I use green tea but I did not find a convenient way to use tea bags.	2010-02-10

The headphones that came with this player is a little on a large size so I am planning to purchase Shure E4C. The leather case that came with a player is not very functional as you cannot pause, skip track or adjust volume while player is in it.

I was looking for a couch to put in my basement that was affordable yet functional. Also I was looking for something that if it got ruined by my freinds that I wouldn't get too upset about it. For 560$ you really cant go wrong. I wasnt expecting much but I was honestly surprised at what I got.<br /><br />Amazon prime delivery... 3 stars. It comes on a palate and they dropped it off in my garage leaving me to haul it into the house. Free delivery.. Can't complain there.<br /><br />Unpacking... pretty straightforward. Unfortunately one of the moisture absorber packets ripped open and there were little silica balls rolling around everywhere in one of the boxes.<br /><br />Assembly... Honestly if you can put together Ikea furntiure you will be fine. Everyone that is complaining about how hard it is... must be challenged. Look at the diagram. Put the threaded screws in the holes  and then fasten the washers. Its not rocket science.<br /><br />Aesthetics... It is a pretty nice looking couch. I will admit I was hoping that the 'pebble' color was going to be a bit more grey and not so tan. The faux leather looks like faux leather. Probably would scratch fairly easily. Also one thing I noticed was that one perk to a more expensive couch is that the pillows can usually be flipped over if you were to spill something on them... not the case here. One side of the cushions are a cheaper black fabric. Again.. 500~$ for a couch.. what do you expect?  The throw pillows were thrown directly into the trash by me.  Microfiber tiger stripes are not my thing.<br /><br />Comfort... Its a bit firm. Much more comfortable if you put your feet up on the ottoman (which is not a storage ottoman) as the seat depth is fairly shallow. The chaise portion is really comfortable though.<br /><br />All things considered, this couch is a great buy for $560 compared to whats out there. It comes delivered to your door with straight forward assembly instructions. Looks nice and is functional. The negative reviews are mostly from people who seem to have set their sights a little too high for what they are spending. This is truely a case of you get what you pay for.

This week I contacted Fiori Belli in order to change something in my order--at the very last minute before it was to ship! Their response was as wonderful as their flowers and fruit.  When I finish this review, I'm going back to their site to place another order.    Thank you so much,    Susan R	2010-11-18

The box was kinda banged up but I checked all of the pieces immediatly and there's not a scratch anywhere on it. The bench itself is more black, no one had mentioned in any of the reviews so I thought some people would want to know. I got this bench for $75 plus $10 for shipping and the cheapest bench I could find anywhere(including Wal-mart) was at least $100 so this was a fantastic find! Don't even hesitate, it's beautiful and you can utilize the storage area underneath for your own personal stuff!	2009-05-15

I have had a XL version of the extreme gear coat since 1998.  I am a carpenter and wear my coat from December through February.  My previous coat went to work with me everyday since then.

This is the most durable, water-resistant, and warm coat I have ever owned.  \\\\\"Gang nails\\\\\" are used in truss frame construction and are notorius for ripping and tearing all articles of clothing and sometimes flesh if you are not cautious.  Not this Carhartt coat or bibs though, I have tested them many times, unintentionally.  The XL version was always a little bulkly for me, but I did not have the option of the \\\\\"tall\\\\\" version and I need the length in the arms and torso.  Now that I have a Large tall size, Carhartt has just moved up another notch on my scale of \\\\\"unparalled clothing manufacturer\\\\\".

I want to make that perfectly clear.<br /><br />I was in desperate need of some real tights in my size in white which no local store around me seem to stock, and when Amazon sent me the email about the dance wear sale I jumped for joy. Once I narrowed down what I was looking for I came to these tights. I took a look at the size chart and nearly made a tragic mistake, the sizing info provided on Amazon is awful, if you go by it for this item you WILL be ordering one size too small and this is something that you really do not want to be doing. Honestly when I tried them on for the first time I feared that I was given the child's size.<br /><br />They are amazingly soft and tight, and so far rather durable since I have big feet and thick thighs, it takes a little work to get them up but once they are on they look fabulous, but on your waist...beware if you have love handles.<br /><br />Also do not to be fooled by the images provided by Amazon. Even though I read the description of these being semi-opaque the image made me believe that it would be a little more solid which is why I took the chance and bought them. They are a bit more opaque than you see in the pictures with the black tights image being a bit more true to the product, the white on my thick thigs come out looking a bit more grey (reason for the 4 stars) but it's rather nice that it looks that way all over and not just white towards the lower leg and moving up to grey.	2012-09-25

"Approaching Normal is my favorite Blue October album to date . . . a challenging feat!  Stephanie Meyer (author of the renowned Twilight series) once remarked that Blue October's music was special because \\\\\"While there are other musicians that can recall to me times in the past where I might have felt sadness or rage or infatuation, it's very rare to find a song that can actually put me in that emotion, rather than just reminding me of it.  There is an empathetic power in Justin's message - the listener doesn't just sympathize with the feeling of the words, the listener has no choice but to feel the words as if the emotions was his/her own.\\\\\"      This new album continues and even extends that experience with songs that take you through an array of emotions from despair to hope to moving on to the next chapter of your life.  This new work further demonstrates the integration of the entire band into a team.  The compositions are rich and underscore the deep messages that Blue October continue to offer to so many of us.  It offers something for everybody and is a great introduction for listeners new to Blue October!"	2009-11-12

Hog Island moves slowly throughout most of it but it's a good, rolling movement that gives viewers time to think. (If you don't want to think, I doubt there is a reason for you to watch this one. Just pass.)I thought it hit on some true emotions that many of us face as adults. It had enough substance in it for me to watch it through to the end, so I'm thinking that after I watch it again, which I will, I might be willing to rate it at least 4 stars. The cinematography was appealing and I loved the nature scenes, which are interspersed throughout the film. I especially enjoyed even the simplest of the water scenes. There was no one character I felt much of an affinity with the whole way through. Yet by the end of the movie I was sorry it was over and there were two characters I identified and empathized with. In other words, Hog Island kind of sneaks up from behind and grabs you when you least expect it...it's THAT kind of film. It has a great soundtrack by Tragedians of the City. I looked them up and could find little information on them and none of the songs. It seems the soundtrack was written for the movie, but I couldn't find any audio on it. Some of the songs are really good. Others were good but just not my taste because they seemed a bit intrusive. Overall, Hog Island ended on me leaving me feeling a bit bereft and quite reflective...can't wait to hear how you feel about it!	2012-11-15

I was sitting in a Sheriff's Office listening to the Judge, the Prosecutor, the Sheriff, and the Public Defender go through the upcoming days cases.  I remember how I was shocked to learn that the cases were tried in the office and the trials were more show than anything.  These were just minor cases but I had an idealistic view of what it was supposed to be!  Years later when I was working in a city far away, I learned that the Prosecutor had been convicted of his fourth DUI in one year and was convicted of felony DUI.  The Sheriff who had gone on to federal law enforcement was fired because he was caught with an underage girl.  Nobody's perfect and there are always a few bad cops, attorneys and judges... thankfully very few!<br /><br />This movie introduces you to the complexities of the judicial system.  It starts with the idealistic view and then slaps you in the face with reality.  It leaves you to make the choice of what is right and what is wrong.  You'll have to decide for yourself what is or would be justice.  From the politics, the backroom deals and the downright corruption it's all there.  It certainly isn't pretty because nobody's perfect.  The acting is great but I've always felt Andy Garcia is a fine actor.  The entire cast was well chosen and you feel their emotions and believe them as their character.  The story moves along well and there are enough twists to keep you interested.  This isn't a movie that leaves you cheering for more.  It does however make you think about the complexities of justice.  When your outside looking in things always look different than when you are inside looking out.	2012-09-11

Easily one of the most stylish, most chilling horror films of the last couple of decades, this one also has a heart (as the best always do).The story plays on both the cards of the heartbroken young widower in grief over his wife's death as well as the both sad and frightening vengeful ghost whose mystery plays out and creating a truly terrifying build-up.<br /><br />For his part, Daniel Radcliffe shows he can work as a reliable adult lead, supported by a highly experienced ensemble cast led by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds. The film itself glories in its dark, broken beauty and makes one reminisce about haunted house classics like The Innocents (1961). There are also fairly potent visual reminders of other classic films such as The Phantom Carriage (1921) and Hammer's own Night Creatures (1962). The colors, though by no means absent, are mostly muted (making a great contrast in the few instances where they exist as striking). The music is minimal, unlike most American horror films that overwhelm with score from beginning to end.<br /><br />The story, adapted directly from the Susan Hill novel of the same name (itself also the source of one of the most iconic, longest-running English plays) features all of the classic elements of a haunted house story: the large, imposing mansion, the foggy, stormy atmosphere, a background in tragedy... it's all there. The tragedy compels us to listen to the story and to open our minds to it. We each experience tragedy and loss in our lives, and that seeking to connect with what (and who) we've lost can lead us down a path of desperation, but we don't know what doors and to what horrors that desperation can lead to. That is one of the great appeals of the gothic ghost story, and it plays out in excellence here. As a traditional ghost story film, The Woman in Black may be \\\\\"by the book,\\\\\" but the book is as chilling as anyone could imagine.ut the book is as chilling as anyone could imagine."	2012-08-07

It's hard to summarize this movie without giving away key parts of the plot - your anxiety and fear for the sister and brother accelerate immensely as the movie progresses and they begin seeing very clear and realistic ghosts from a past that increasingly seems connected to them.<br /><br />This movie is well done, but it takes a very long time to tell the story and there are some pretty violent, repetitive scenes of the murder of a family that connects to their own past. I think the end did not tie up very strongly, though I found the the last moments to be very moving - showing in a very graphic way the sacrifices that have been made for Spain by the victims of its past. Although not as strong as Il Orfanato or The Devil's Backbone, this is another film that suggests a brilliantly developing film genre in Spain.	2012-05-07

Nevertheless, the plot is contrived and bestows hero status on a lawman that supposedly grew up in the South, but comes across vividly as a typical northeastern character, dressed up superficially as a southerner. The main problem with the show is the obvious fact that the bad guys in the south would have killed the beafied marshal and ended is noble crusade against the fatuous people of the south. Timothy Olyphant is a problematic actor--in Deadwood he brought his character to life and was more or less convincing.  In Justified, he lacks the acting skills to transcend the flat character, created by the authors/producers of this show. Most of the time he has this confident, bordering on smug, look on his face that asks the viewer to consider him a really bad-ass who takes no guff from anyone. Although Walton Goggins, who plays the half-crazed villain (who likes to blow things up or start and watch fires) is excellent in his role, he still in essence is just another hillbilly hick that all discerning viewers should look down on. Also, it beggars belief to think that the marshal's ex-wife would marry such a milquetoast loser. All in all, Justified is entertaining, but lacks even a modicum of depth and complexity that make life authentic and interesting."	2012-03-20

My favorite features are the different backgrounds and the adjustable windows. I don't like too many games that make you choose between a full-screen version or a tiny window. I have a 23&#34; Apple Cinema and like being able to use the full screen when I want or drag the window to the size that works best at the moment with other apps running that I need to keep an eye on.<br /><br />The game is very pretty to look at while playing. I wish it had fully customizable backgrounds to allow using my own images. I also wish it had different tile options. I found the background music annoying after only a little amount of time but I'm not a big fan of background music for most games so I am glad the music can be disabled, especially when I don't want to disturb others. Another nice feature would be an un-timed mode. I would recommend this game to others that enjoy Mahjong if they weren't looking for a lot of features and want something that is pretty as well as stable and simple.	2014-03-12

I was hesitant to buy this because of all the complaining about Origin, the EA version of steam (where you launch the games campaign, multiplayer and co op modes). Yes it is essentially a website that is somewhat a pain because you have to go through it to launch the game but it's not nearly as bad as what people have made it out to be. Just like anything new, you have trouble navigating the new system and just like anything it becomes easy once you get the hang of it. My only concern with the way this is set up is what happens if the internet is down. Since all modes are launched via website, it seems like you cannot even play campaign if the net is down. I haven't tried launching it without internet so that may not be true. In any case, the game is great both campaign and the multiplayer. Origin isn't as bad as what people say and for this price, why not play it? This game is $59.99 on origin and in stores, go AMAZON for saving me hundreds over the years!!!	2012-05-08

Tapping sequences for combo attacks and dodging in a PC cRPG?! I loved it!<br />You can opt for either Blood Magic (melee) or Soul Magic (ranged), but to mix-and-match from the skill trees is a solid advice.<br /><br />As with another cRPG gem to come out of Eastern Europe this season (THE WITCHER), loading-delays are a nuisance; surprisingly, though, they are shorter than those encountered in games developed by much larger studios. The BALDUR's GATE Saga had long loading times as well, yet I hardly ever noticed.<br />What WILL get on your nerves though is the...camera. If you thought that NWN had bad camera movement, well, this is worse: it moves in a very limited range and will take some time to get used to and find a comfortable setting.<br /><br />Graphically it would be placed just above DUNGEON SIEGE: the spells have been impressively designed and the cut-scenes have been done in stills of exceptional taste. Moreover, one has to appreciate the fact that all dialog is spoken, not just written. The music though is a collection staple cRPG themes that are neither annoying nor unforgettable.<br /><br />The official Minimun Requirements will hardly ensure a smooth gameplay, so make sure your system at least meets the Recommended Requirements (provided below):<br />· P4 3GHz (or AMD equivalent)<br />· 1GB of RAM<br />· nVidia 256MB 7600GS (or ATI equivalent)<br />· 4.4GB HDD free space<br />· WinXP<br /><br />This is a long cRPG, spanning for over 20-25 hours if one undertakes all possible quests (ranging from funny to quite intense).

It's too soon to see if it made a difference, but my daughter LOVES the soothie bottles and paci's now!  It took weeks before she'd take a Mam and over a week before she'd successfully drink from a Gerber bottle, but she took to Soothies instantly and in 5 mins or less prefered them to the products she'd been using for months!  They're so much easier for her to suck and hold in her mouth.  The price is great too, about 1/2 the price of the same set with Avent products.   <br /> <br />My 2 complaints are: 1) the leaking bottles and 2) the pacifier looks weird and doesn't attach to a pacifier keeper.  The leaking can be fixed by getting the part where the rim of the bottle meets the nipple wet to create a full seal.  Also, it helps to \\\\\"swirl\\\\\" the formula to mix instead of \\\\\"shaking\\\\\" it... it takes a bit longer, but you end up with less mess and less bubbles."	2006-06-02

I used to hate always having to wait for a full dishwasher to be loaded before I can run it. Most nights I just use the top drawer because I hand wash my good pots and pans. I love that I can put so many place settings into the dishdrawers. The organization of the tines is well thought out. I usually only use the bottom drawer when I have a dinner party or have a few large bulky items. This also washes wine glasses without breaking them which is a huge plus. I have had three of these units in various homes and have never regretted it. I highly recommend this product.	2015-02-12

SilverTop Load Washer - Energy Star	Major Appliances	1	3	3	N	N	Whirlpool should recall the Cabrio washer	I am very dissatisfied with the Whirlpool Cabrio washer.  The water level stays so low that the cleaning is only mediocre and the rinsing is terrible.  Even using an extra rinse cycle, my dark cottons come out with streaks and splashes of white, from the detergent, and look unsightly.  These streaks have to be sponged off by hand with a wet towel or they will still be visible after drying the clothes.  I have tried different detergents--both powder and liquid, as well as different brands.  I have tried different spin speeds and water temperatures.  I have called Whirlpool as well Lowes, where we purchased the machine, and neither offered any helpful advice.  The Whirlpool rep agreed that my machine's performance is unacceptable but offered no remedy and would not transfer me to any higher employee to speak to.  To me, this says that Whirlpool does not stand behind its products, and if a product does not perform well, that's the buyer's problem.  I will not be buying any other products from Whirlpool, including the dryer that would have matched this washer.  In addition to the washing and rinsing problem, the laundry comes out of the washer very wrinkled and hardly wet, due to the high spin speed.  The idea is that this saves energy by reducing drying time.  The purpose is defeated, however, when you have to dampen the clothes before drying, in order to get some of the wrinkles out.  I would strongly advise any potential buyers to steer clear of this machine and all Whirlpool products in general.	2013-09-28

FUN! hahaha	I've played plenty of tower defense type games in the past but this one really shines from the rest. It is very original compared to the generic tower defense games out there that are all similar to each other one way or another. Plants vs. Zombies just doesn't compare to anything else I've played. Taking advantage of the free WiFi download was such an awesome opportunity. I really recommend this game to any kind of gamers out there, casual to hardcore. It will really test your tower defense skills and make you laugh at some of the different kinds of zombies there are. There is a lot of variety in the towers you can build as well, and the levels change to a different location as you progress farther along.    I currently use PrizeRebel to get games that I want when I can't afford them. It's really reliable and takes little to no effort on your part.

I know, crazy right?  Anyways, this is now my default keyboard.  I love it!    I love the swiftkey-like keyboard but what really excites me is that I swear it is reading my mind.  Even when I miss a letter it almost always picks the word I was trying to type.  Only one rare circumstances does it choose the wrong word but the correct word is usually one of the other choices.    The only thing it needs to fix is that when I am typing numbers in the middle of a sentence it doesn't add a space after the previous word typed.    The bottom line is that this is easy to use and I have noticed that I'm a lot more faster when typing things than I was before.  In fact, I'm faster now with one thumb than I was before with two.    I highly recommend this keyboard replacement.	2011-05-18

It addition to taking photos it takes quicktime videos.  Its fairly simply to understand and has really good quality pictures. Uploading is a breeze, so extreemy easy.   I would give it 5 stars if it werent for its memory and battery life compatibility.  The camera is a battery eater.  I bought it on vacation with me and it was out of batteries within 2 days.  Its also a memory eater, if you want good pictures that is.  It has an internal memory of 16MB.  That takes about 40 good pictures and has about 100 seconds of video.  If you buy it I suggest you but the Memory Card for it becuase youll be glad you did. Overall its a good camera and I really enjoy using it.	2003-08-11

I bought this camcorder back in July and I have enjoyed it ever since.  I have taken a lot of footage of skateboarding in my area and such.  All I need to do is find a cheap fish-eye lens, and some cables to go to my PC.  Can anyone help me find the right cable for this camera to a PC?  Thanks. Joelizlar@mediaone.net	2000-11-20

Our new puppy immediately loved it. We had to travel two hours to pick her up and on the way back the comforting heartbeat kept her very calm and happy the whole trip. I had the breeder put the Snuggle Puppy in the kennel before we left to take along the scent for additional comfort. The first few nights went much better with the ever present heartbeat. Since then this is her favorite toy.	2007-05-12

Rabbie Labowitz has written a spiritual guide that leads the reader on a wonderful journey of discovery.  Each page brings new insights into the awareness of the reader and shows the reader the paths available in the journey we call life.<br /> Miraculous Living beautifully describes the Kabbalah's 10 gates of the Tree of Life and the TAO. The commonalities of the two ancient and important works unfold before the readers eyes.  Each gate includes a meditation that supports and enhances the message.<br /> While written in  very different sytes, I found that the truths of Miraculous Living are the foundation of books such as &quot;Simple Abundance&quot; and wonderful companions to books such as &quot;Anatomy of the Spirit&quot;.<br /> Take time to savor Miraulous Living and you will be on the Journey of a lifetime	1997-07-22

That magnificent chronicler of old Imperial Vienna - the Vienna of sweet young things (usually working- or middle-class), slightly neurotic but charming young men (usually upper-class), and their fleeting love-affairs, terminated so easily once ennui starts to exceed pleasure, the Vienna of walks in the Prater and talks in the cafes (ever so full of interesting artistic types), the Vienna where the nostalgic strains of Johann Strauss provide a suitably bittersweet accompaniment to the beginning (or the ending) of the abovementioned love-affairs ...<br /><br />All of which occur in The Road into the Open; nevertheless, the Vienna depicted here does not only consist of only the sweetened tableaux so frequently dismissively (and unfairly) attributed to Schnitzler.  The easy charm of the Vienna here is extant, but by no means idealised - it masks the artistic impotence that seems to afflict nearly all of its inhabitants, haunted as they are by the sense of being epigonal; grandiose artistic projects are continually being talked about, but never executed, whether because of an aversion to actually setting them down on paper, or simply because of what is commonly called a &quot;lack of inspiration&quot;.  More sinisterly, it also masks the habitual anti-Semitism of what one of the characters wittily calls those of &quot;indigenous physiognomy&quot;; though written in 1908, there are passages that almost foreshadow the rise of Nazism.  Schnitzler subtly intertwines the study of the individual with ruthlessly objective social commentary and evocation of the atmosphere (both artistic and political) of fin de siecle Vienna, to produce a fascinating book highly recommended not only for those with an interest in the period, but also for anyone who fancies a thought-provoking book	1996-09-13

This product is somewhat of a waste of time depending on your teeth.  Unless your teeth are perfectly straight you can hardly get the floss/pick in between your teeth and once you do get it in between your teeth you can hardly move the floss up and down or left to right because there is no power in just holding the device with one hand.  Also, I think that even if your teeth are perfectly straight (which I doubt everyones is) I doubt you still will be able to use this product properly because of just how weak the floss and your control over the product is.	2004-10-19
